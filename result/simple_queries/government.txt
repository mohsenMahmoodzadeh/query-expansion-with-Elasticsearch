    "title": "Does Congress Get Paid While Military Personnel Do Not During a Government Shutdown?",

    "claim": "Members of Congress continue to get paid but military personnel do not during a U.S. government shutdown.",
    "content": " Much of the United States government ceased operations at midnight on 20 January 2018 after Congress failed to pass a short-term funding bill to keep the government going, until a permanent appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 could be hammered out. A government shutdown means all but the most essential operations come to a halt and many federal employees are furloughed and most stop receiving paychecks until Congress breaks its deadlock and funding is restored. Along with questions about mail delivery, Social Security payments, and whether or not national parks would be open through the shutdown, some readers wanted to know if members of the military are still on duty, and whether they get paid.  Some readers put the question this way: \u201cIs it true that members of Congress still get paid during a government shutdown, while military personnel do not?\u201d The short answer to the question is yes. Unlike most federal workers and members of the military, whose pay must be appropriated annually, the salaries of House and Senate members are permanently authorized in the U.S. Constitution.       With respect to the military, an U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) memo issued on 18 January and signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan: The Department will, of course, continue to prosecute the war in Afghanistan and ongoing operations against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, including preparation of forces for deployment into those conflicts. The Department must, as well, continue many other operations necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property (a copy of military operations necessary for national security will be supplied separately). These activities will be \u201cexcepted\u201d from the effects of a lapse in appropriations: all other activities would need to be shut down in an orderly and deliberate fashion, including \u2013 with few exceptions \u2013 the cessation of temporary duty travel. All military personnel performing active duty will continue in a normal duty status regardless of their affiliation with excepted or non-excepted activities. Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress makes appropriated funds available to compensate them for this period of service. Civilian personnel who are necessary to carry out or support excepted activities will also continue in normal duty status and also will not be paid until Congress makes appropriated funds available. Civilian employees paid from lapsed appropriations and who are not necessary to carry out or support excepted activities will be furloughed, i.e., placed in a non-work, non-pay status. The last time a government shutdown of this kind occurred, in September 2013, the House and Senate unanimously passed a bill ensuring that military paychecks would continue. Similar effort this time around failed. Regarding House and Senate members\u2019 pay, the Congressional Research Service notes that: Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution authorizes compensation for Members of Congress \u201cascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\u201d Adjustments are governed by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 and the 27th Amendment to the Constitution. This means members of Congress are paid regardless of the status of the federal budget. Although an eleventh-hour bill calling for withholding members\u2019 salaries was introduced before the shutdown, it failed to pass. Some members have announced they will voluntarily forego their salaries until government funding is restored, with some pledging to donate their pay to charity. A vote in the U.S. Senate to end the shutdown by passing a short-term (three-week) spending bill was scheduled to take place at noon EST on 22 January. ",

    "content": "  Claim:  President Obama has issued an executive order granting a $2,350 dollar tax rebate to every American who filed a tax return for 2014. FALSE Example: [Collected via e-mail, November 2015] Some women at work were discussing the following: Apparently they saw on Facebook that, as an executive order by President Obama, the government is giving everyone who filed 2014 taxes a $2,350.00 rebate/refund to be mailed out this month (November 12, 2015). I have looked everywhere (on the Internet) that I can think of. The only place I can find it is on a site called \u201cUnited Media Publishing\u201d. Also, the only reference to this that I can find on Facebook sends a person to this same article from United Media Publishing. Is this true??? Origins: On 14 August 2015 the web site United Media Publishing (UMP) issued an article titled \u201cObama Orders 2350 Dollar Tax Rebate In November\u201d which reported that: The Obama administration has directed IRS director John Koskinen to have the agency prepare for one of the largest cash refund/rebate hand-outs in the history of the organization. The President has authorized by way of an executive order that a 2350 dollar tax rebate be issued to every American who filed a tax return in the 2014 fiscal year, irrespective of whether they paid tax or not. Update: A representative for the IRS confirms that the first tax rebate checks will go into the mail November 12th. While United Media Publishing\u2018s initial claim didn\u2019t attract much attention on social media, the highlighted portion in the above-reproduced excerpt breathed new life into the hoax in early November 2015. Unfortunately for readers (hopeful that an unexpected $2,350 windfall was headed their way at Christmastime), United Media Publishing is nothing more than a fake news site, one that doesn\u2019t feature a disclaimer notice identifying its content as fake news. Prior fabrications spread by UMP included a Charles Manson death hoax and a story about thousands of Christian couples filing for divorce in protest of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on gay marriage.

    "claim": "Scam: Advertisements offer thousands of dollars of \"free money\" available in the form of government grants.",
    "content": " Scams are omnipresent, but difficult economic times create an environment in which more people are more willing (or desperate) to be tempted by promises of \u201cfree\u201d money. Since early 2009 we have seen seen a marked increase in the prevalence of \u201cgovernment grant\u201d scams, many of which are promoted as offering funds made available to the public through the economic stimulus package recently passed by the U.S. Congress.  If you have received this email, take a time to really read it carefully! You may be one of the luckiest people ever to get a Government Funded Grant. This Grant Kit could put thousands of dollars in your pocket. If you are in need of a financial assistance, you may qualify for a piece of the millions and millions of dollars awarded each year by private and government grant agencies to regular people like you. What makes grants so exciting is that most of the money is awarded INTEREST-FREE. So, unlike a bank loan, you won\u2019t see interest charges eating away at your obligations. That\u2019s a better offer than any bank will ever provide you. Many grants go unawarded every year, simply because most people don\u2019t know about the programs they may qualify for. Don\u2019t let this happen to you! Join this great program right away with no risk at all! Send us an email back if you are interested to participate in the easy Government Funded Grant program. Don\u2019t miss your chance, as chances like that don\u2019t happen very often in our lives!      There is a telephone scam that is targeting people across the nation. The caller identifies himself as a representative of the Government Grant Association. The caller then leads the person to believe they have qualified for a government grant and in order to pay out the grant they need the persons bank account number or they have the account number and need the person to verify the account number.  Such frauds are typically touted to Internet users through e-mails like the first example cited above or through a plethora of similar web-based advertisements, or to the off-line world through telephone solicitations. Regardless of form, all such schemes produce the same end result: Unsuspecting victims lured by the promise of \u201cfree\u201d money or loans made available to them via government grants end up paying hundreds of dollars (or more) in up-front fees for grants that never materialize, leaving those who have been led to believe they were about to be enriched to the tune of thousands of dollars sadly disappointed and considerably poorer:  The way the scam usually works is that consumers are told grant information is available for a small payment by credit card. But buried deep inside the small print of the agreements on the [web] sites is enrollment in multiple paid programs.  Eventually the consumer could be out several hundred dollars or even more than $1,000 In additional to the [web] sites, several e-mail frauds having to do with the stimulus package have been reported to the [Federal Trade Commission]. The typical e-mail, which promises that the recipient has already been awarded a grant, asks for personal financial information. Responding to the message could result in identity theft.        \u201cPrepayment\u201d frauds are far from brand-spanking new: Many successful flim-flams hold out the carrot of big money (which never materializes no matter how hard it is chased after) to seduce the gullible into parting with some of their hard-earned funds. Those so gulled have acted on the belief they were arranging hard-to-secure loans at very favorable rates, often with distant countries said to be rabid with desire to lend to Americans. Or they were promised access to little-known and almost-forgotten college grants. Or they received the news they\u2019d won fabulous wealth in foreign lotteries they had no recollection of entering. Even the venerable Nigerian scam is a prepayment con: though its victims initially believe that for helping distressed foreigners move large sums of cash from their country they will receive millions of dollars, very early into the process they discover they will have to dole out innumerable sums to various folks to bring this about. Folks conned via prepayment schemes mistakenly believe they stand to gain vast amounts of something for practically nothing. Acting on that faith, they willingly part with funds they would ordinarily be loath to spend yet which by comparison to the prizes about to be gained momentarily appear to be relatively small sums.  The \u2018government grant\u2019 fraud operates on that principle. Those who are contacted by such cheats (or who respond to Internet-based advertisements) are told they are entitled to lay claim to government grants worth thousands of dollars. In return for their banking information and/or what seems like an insignificant processing fee of a few hundred dollars, said grants will be directly deposited into their accounts. Those who suspect something might be wrong with the notion of the government\u2019s handing them money for no discernable reason are told they are eligible for this form of largesse as a reward for their having paid their taxes promptly for the past few years or because they\u2019re senior citizens. Folks who further quibble with the process are issued all manner of guarantees, including the provision of 800 numbers to call if at any time they wish to bow out and have their up-front fees refunded. \u201cSupervisors\u201d may join phone conversations between scam artists and their potential pigeons to assure those evincing doubts about the government wanting to give them money that everything is meticulously legitimate. The doubters may also be given the addresses of web sites to examine which, they are told, will explain in far greater detail how these grants operate. These promises and seeming proofs serve only one purpose, and it is not the protection of the consumer \u2014 they work to lend an air of legitimacy to the pitch so as to soothe the suspicions of those about to be taken. Very few will think to call those numbers; they will instead trust that what they have been told are guarantees are in fact valid ones. Those inquisitive enough to dial those 800 numbers find they either go unanswered or have been disconnected.   Those operating versions of this scam have in the past identified themselves as representatives of granting agencies with such names as the Government Grant Center, Consumer Grants USA, Ultimate Funding Inc., Government Grant USA, Federal Government Information Center, Federal Government Grant Information Center, National Grant Center, Federal Research Funding, Customer Care Plus, and Department of Revenue. However, that a purported grant facilitation entity is not listed above in no way proves it is on the up-and-up, so no comfort should be taken from its absence. Swindlers routinely invent impressive-sounding names and titles for themselves and the entities they supposedly represent. \u201cThat\u2019s what scam artists do,\u201d said Pat Coakley of the Better Business Bureau, \u201cthey operate under a variety of names and phone numbers, then leave town and start all over again under other assumed names.\u201d As to how the con is run, one of our readers who was contacted by someone intent upon victimizing him with the \u2018government grant\u2019 scheme reported this exchange:  [Bryan]    Good morning, this is Bryan. [Swindler]    My name is Alec Watson. (Female with a Indian or Pakistan accent.)  [Bryan]    This is Bryan. [Swindler]    Can I speak with Bryan P. please? [Bryan]    Speaking. (I never answer in an affirmative manner anymore. I once had my long distance carrier changed because I said yes when they asked me if I was Bryan. Once they recorded my yes they had me saying yes to anything.) [Swindler]    Again, my name is Alec Watson from the Las Vegas Government Grant Processing Center. And you have been approved to receive an eight thousand dollar grant. We would like to verify your information. Do you live at _____? Do you still work for _____? [Bryan]    Correct. Why would I get a grant for $8,000? [Swindler]    We have noticed that you have paid your taxes on time for the last 20 years. Can you please verify your bank? [Bryan]    North Island Financial Credit Union. [Swindler]    Can you tell me what your bank routing number is? [Bryan]    No, I cannot. [Swindler]    Bryan, we can process you for $8,000 for a full free grant. We can automatically withdraw the processing amount from your back account. Do you think that a cost of $257 is worth receiving $8,000? [Bryan]    Well, if you\u2019re charging me $257 then it isn\u2019t free, now is it? [Swindler]    I can give you a few minutes to get your checkbook. [Bryan]    I am at work. I do not have a checkbook with me. (Not kidding \u2014 my wife knows better then to send me to work with a checkbook during the holidays.) [Swindler]    A deposit slip? [Bryan]    No. [Swindler]    Sir, we cannot finish without your banking routing number; can you call someone at home and receive it? [Bryan]    Why can\u2019t you subtract the money from the grant? [Swindler]    Because we are not allowed to touch the grant money. Did you get your checking information yet? [Bryan]    Please remove me from your calling list. [Swindler]    Bryan, you don\u2019t want the $8,000? We are not authorized to remove you. [Bryan]    Ok, I found you on the web and it says you are a rip off. Please let me talk to a supervisor. [Swindler]    CLICK  As Bryan experienced, the quite-reasonable question of \u201cWhy can\u2019t you deduct the fee from the funds you\u2019ll be sending me?\u201d is always countered by the claim that it is impossible to do so. Others who have been party to such come-ons report being told laws precluded the use of the grant (or loan or scholarship or lottery prize) for anything other that its designated purpose, which included barring use of even a small part of those funds for payment of processing fees.  Bryan\u2019s example also shows how much he was pressured to provide his banking information. Someone less aware of the possibility of being conned might well have given up that number under such a barrage.  The scam succeeds as well as it does thanks in part to the many television commercials touting free government money. (Such advertisers are vending books containing the contact information for a variety of government grants, loans, and subsidies.) Though there are genuine government grants to be had, they are not available to just anyone for no purpose. Forget about the ads on television or the Internet \u2014 there are not untold troves of government funds available just for the asking. Grants are awarded on the basis of specific criteria having been met for specific programs. Such grants are very strictly administered, require the completion of a great deal of paperwork, and are overseen at every step. These are not \u201cFill out a simple form, then cash a huge check\u201d types of propositions; these are \u201cProve to us that you qualify under this program then, provided you are engaged in the activity we are interested in fostering, we might subsidize some of your costs\u201d sorts of deals. The hoops to be jumped through are many and varied, and there is precious little by way of a freebie to it. Regarding the government grant scam, keep these three points in mind:   The U.S. Government does not telephone people to offer them grants.  Grants are never guaranteed, nor are they issued for no apparent purpose, so folks should be downright suspicious of any talk of grants where the words \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cguarantee\u201d are bandied about.  Real government grants require extensive documentation with great attention to detail. There is nothing simple or painless about securing a government grant.  How to Avoid Falling Victim to Prepayment Scams:   Above all else, have nothing to do with \u2018deal of a lifetime\u2019 offers that require payment in advance of fees. Do not fall in with schemes whereby you are required to prepay taxes on lottery winnings, or pay to have a prize shipped to you, or are to be charged a loan application fee. Do not pay someone for the privilege of working for them.  With regard to \u2018free government grants\u2019 come-ons, disabuse yourself of the notion that the U.S. government is in the business of providing grants (aka free money) to whichever of its citizens have made it their habit to pay their taxes on time. (Rather, the U.S. government offers a disincentive to those who are tardy with their payments \u2014 it assesses penalties for deadlines missed and charges interest on the amounts overdue.)   Stop believing in the chimera of \u201csomething for nothing.\u201d   ",

    "content": "  Claim:   The toll-free phone number for the \u201cObamacare national call center\u201d spells out a crude phrase.  PARTLY TRUE        Example:   [Collected via e-mail, October 2013]  Is it true that the nationwide phone number for Obamacare is 1-800-FUCKYO?      Origins:   Back in July 2013, prior to the opening of PPACA-created state- and federal-run insurance exchange marketplaces on 1 October 2013, the federal government\u2019s web site at www.healthcare.gov published a blog post to help consumers with questions about the new Health Insurance Marketplace.  That post helpfully noted that one method available for obtaining answers to Health Insurance Marketplace questions was to call a 24-hour, toll-free phone number and speak with a customer service representative:   Call us right now to get your Marketplace questions answered by a customer service representative, available 24/7: 1-800-318-2596         On 3 October 2013, the Daily Caller reported that the \u201cObamacare\u2019s national call center\u201d phone number could also be rendered as 1-800-FUCKYO.   Although 800-318-2596 is the correct phone number for the Health Insurance Marketplace  customer service line, and turning its digits into letters as they are found on   telephone keypads does produce the phrase 800-FUCKYO (among many other possibilities), that transformation only works because of the quirk that the digit \u20181\u2019 is  not represented by a letter on standard U.S. telephone keypads.   Technically, the 800-318-2596 phone number cannot correctly be rendered as 800-FUCKYO because that designation omits the essential \u20181\u2019 digit between the \u20183\u2019 and \u20188\u2019 and therefore does not represent an accurate phone number for the Health Insurance Marketplace hotline (or a valid phone number at all).  A correct rendering of the phone number would be the somewhat less salacious 1-800-F1UCKYO. Additionally, the 800-318-2596 phone number wasn\u2019t selected by the current administration, as it has been used as a toll-free government number for providing information about Medicare plans since at least as far back as 1999. The current assignee of the 1-800-FUCKYOU number (a phone sex line) has now updated their initial recording greeting with a message asking callers to indicate whether or not they are calling about Obamacare.

    "claim": "Arkansas landlord Annette Cowen informed tenants at her rental properties they could face eviction if they failed to pay rent as a result of lacking the income provided by government housing subsidy programs.",
    "content": " A January 2019 letter from a landlord in Arkansas to her tenants highlighted the mounting concern over the effect of an ongoing partial government shutdown on persons relying upon federal assistance to cover their housing costs. Annette Cowen\u2019s directive to residents at the apartment complexes she runs in the state was first reported by local news outlets before spreading online: To all tenants: Due to the shutdown of the federal government, your rental assistance portion of your rent is not being paid. As of now, you have no rental assistance and your rent must be paid prior to January 20th or eviction procedures may begin against you. Until the government opens again, you are responsible for ALL your rental amount. Your complex is not in the business of furnishing free rent. Rent must be paid prior to January 20th or eviction proceedings may begin against you. If rents are not collected the complex has no money to pay bills including water, sewer and garbage. I would suggest you personally contact your Senators and Representatives in Washington D.C. if you want your rental assistance to be paid. You must pay all your rent immediately.  Cowen told another local news outlet she wanted her tenants to understand her \u201csituation.\u201d       \u201cIt\u2019s more than just having a roof over their head,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat good is that if there is no water and no heat.\u201d A number of the residents renting from Cowen take part in the Section 515 rural housing program operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). That program is for people with low to moderate incomes or living with disabilities. But it is unclear whether Cowen would have the ability to carry out evictions in the event the government shutdown, which began in December 2018, continued to stop landlords from receiving the federal subsidies. Those funds help people who use Section 515 or its counterpart, Section 8, the program administered by the federal department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \u201cThere\u2019s no way that they can evict anybody,\u201d Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota said of the situation concerning her tenants. Peterson is the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, which oversees the USDA. Also, at least one HUD regulation on housing vouchers issued under Section 8 states that tenants cannot be evicted in the event their voucher payments are not available. The agency itself advised landlords taking part in programs serving multi-family households in a letter on 4 January 2019 that they use their own reserve accounts to cover a lapse in funding, instead of carrying out evictions. Thirteen days after HUD\u2019s letter to landlords, Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, both Democrats, released their own letter signed by 170 Democratic Party lawmakers urging President Donald Trump to re-open HUD to avoid a potential crisis. That letter read in part: \u201cThe American people should not be used as leverage, or be held hostage, to fulfill a political agenda. The longer this shutdown extends, the more harm will be done to seniors, families with children, people with disabilities, and other Americans who rely on these programs. We urge you to end this shutdown and provide immediate relief to Americans being impacted by this funding crisis. In these times of uncertainty and tension, we must continue to prioritize the American people.\u201d Republican lawmaker Rick Crawford, who represents Arkansas\u2019s First Congressional District, said of the possibility of evictions: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d We contacted his office asking if he had specific actions in mind to avoid that prospect but did not hear back. Days after Cowen\u2019s letter circulated online, she said she had been contacted by a USDA official who told her there would be enough funding to provide subsidies for her tenants relying on them through at least February 2019. \u201cYou all did a really good job by contacting your senators and representatives and you all got the job done!\u201d she said in a new letter to residents. \u201cYou can be assured that all the news people are aware of our situation both statewide and nationwide. Thank you for the help! Your voice does matter! Hopefully our government will open back up soon and our lives will be back to normal.\u201d We also contacted the House Committee on Financial Services asking for more specific information as to how long the program helping Cowen\u2019s tenants could be funded in the event that the government shutdown extended past January 2019, but had yet to hear back.

    "claim": "In 1926, the federal government poisoned alcohol to curb consumption during Prohibition; by the time Prohibition ended in 1933, an estimated 10,000 people had died from this poisoning.",
    "content": " As if Americans hadn\u2019t accumulated enough dark suspicions about their government over the past 50-odd years, along comes an Internet factoid holding that the United States government intentionally (and fatally) poisoned more than 10,000 of its own citizens between 1926 and 1933:  The alarming claim is that the U.S. government added poison to alcohol to discourage people from drinking it during Prohibition, the period from 1920 to 1933 in which it was illegal to produce, transport, or sell alcoholic beverages anywhere in the United States. That didn\u2019t mean people stopped making, buying, and drinking booze \u2014 they just did it illegally. As noted in virtually every U.S. history textbook ever written, one of the many negative unintended consequences of Prohibition was a booming black market in alcohol that law enforcement was never able to subdue. To the question at hand: Did the federal government really add poison to alcohol to discourage people from drinking it? It did, in fact. The government did purposely add poisonous substances to alcohol, and this did result in thousands of deaths during Prohibition. The story of how that came to pass is longer and more nuanced than the Internet meme suggests, however. And it began well before the passage of the 18th Amendment, which made Prohibition the law of the land.       According to Deborah Blum, author of The Poisoner\u2019s Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York (Penguin Press, 2010), the practice was called \u201cdenaturing\u201d. It consisted of adding noxious chemicals to alcohol sold for industrial purposes to make it unfit for human consumption. The process, long used in Europe, was introduced in the United States in 1906 as a means of exempting producers of alcohol used in paints, solvents, and the like from having to pay the taxes levied on potable spirits. Mainly, this was done by adding some methyl alcohol (\u201cwood alcohol\u201d) to grain alcohol, rendering it poisonous. Some formulas also contained substances that made the product taste too awful to drink. One of the ways crime syndicates tried to flout Prohibition, Blum explained in a 2010 Slate article, was stealing industrial alcohol and finding ways to make it potable. The government, in turn, resorted to making it more poisonous: To sell the stolen industrial alcohol, the liquor syndicates employed chemists to \u201crenature\u201d the products, returning them to a drinkable state. The bootleggers paid their chemists a lot more than the government did, and they excelled at their job. Stolen and redistilled alcohol became the primary source of liquor in the country. So federal officials ordered manufacturers to make their products far more deadly. By mid-1927, the new denaturing formulas included some notable poisons\u2014kerosene and brucine (a plant alkaloid closely related to strychnine), gasoline, benzene, cadmium, iodine, zinc, mercury salts, nicotine, ether, formaldehyde, chloroform, camphor, carbolic acid, quinine, and acetone. The Treasury Department also demanded more methyl alcohol be added\u2014up to 10 percent of total product. It was the last that proved most deadly. TIME magazine\u2019s 2008 Prohibition retrospective described the horrendous consequences of an unregulated \u2014 and, in many instances, purposely adulterated \u2014 black-market liquor supply: It wasn\u2019t just the violent Prohibition-era gang wars that were dangerous to Americans drinking homemade moonshine and bathtub gin. According to the Dec. 26, 1922 edition of the New York Times, five people were killed in the city on Christmas Day from drinking \u201cpoisoned rum.\u201d That was only the beginning. By 1926, according to Prohibition, by Edward Behr, 750 New Yorkers perished from such poisoning and hundreds of thousands more suffered irreversible injuries including blindness and paralysis. On New Year\u2019s Day 1927, 41 people died at New York\u2019s Bellevue Hospital from alcohol-related poisonings. Oftentimes, they were drinking industrial methanol, otherwise known as wood alcohol, which was a legal but extremely dangerous poison. One government report said that of 480,000 gallons of liquor confiscated in New York in 1927, nearly all contained poisons. Although it is inaccurate in the sense that none of this deadly business began in 1926, the factoid we set out to investigate wasn\u2019t entirely wrong in citing that year as a pivotal one. Blum points out that the spate of alcohol-related poisonings that culminated in so many fatalities on New Year\u2019s Day 1927 actually commenced a week earlier, on Christmas: It was Christmas Eve 1926, the streets aglitter with snow and lights, when the man afraid of Santa Claus stumbled into the emergency room at New York City\u2019s Bellevue Hospital. He was flushed, gasping with fear: Santa Claus, he kept telling the nurses, was just behind him, wielding a baseball bat. Before hospital staff realized how sick he was\u2014the alcohol-induced hallucination was just a symptom\u2014the man died. So did another holiday partygoer. And another. As dusk fell on Christmas, the hospital staff tallied up more than 60 people made desperately ill by alcohol and eight dead from it. Within the next two days, yet another 23 people died in the city from celebrating the season. As for the claim that some 10,000 people died of alcohol poisoning during the course of Prohibition through its repeal in 1933, that, too, is a figure we can source to Blum (who did not, in the Slate article, specify where this estimate came from): Frustrated that people continued to consume so much alcohol even after it was banned, federal officials had decided to try a different kind of enforcement. They ordered the poisoning of industrial alcohols manufactured in the United States, products regularly stolen by bootleggers and resold as drinkable spirits. The idea was to scare people into giving up illicit drinking. Instead, by the time Prohibition ended in 1933, the federal poisoning program, by some estimates, had killed at least 10,000 people. In sum, federal attempts to reduce the palatability of industrial alcohol came well before Prohibition, and efforts to intensify the risks of consuming it were both well-known and controversial at the time. Such evidence as we\u2019ve seen does not support the the implication that the government set out to purposely kill drinkers of alcohol, although Prohibition-era lawmakers and public health experts decried what they described as a callous disregard for those who died as result of drinking denatured alcohol.

    "content": " Claim:   To impress upon readers the importance of casting their votes, lists circulate that perpetuate a variety of \u201cone vote\u201d canards, such as:   In 1645, one vote gave Oliver Cromwell control of England.  In 1649, one vote caused Charles I of England to be executed.  In 1776, one vote gave America the English language instead of German.  In 1845, one vote brought Texas into the Union.  In 1875, one vote changed France from a monarchy to a republic.  In 1923, one vote gave Adolf Hitler leadership of the Nazi Party.  In 1941, one vote saved Selective Service \u2013 just weeks before Pearl Harbor was attacked.    Status:   All the above claims are false.  Origins:   Regardless of the value of casting a ballot, the fervor to incite others to vote doesn\u2019t abrogate the need to be factual in the claims used as prods. The falsities listed above routinely find their way into the media, most likely because they have so often been circulated as part of larger lists detailing incidents where one vote made an important difference that this year\u2019s inciter doesn\u2019t think to question        them. Worse, not only are these lists published as gospel both in the traditional print media and on the Internet, they often survive attempts to debunk the various erroneous claims made in them. Election year after election year, screwball \u201cone vote\u201d lists have life breathed back into them through impassioned readers\u2019 letters on the editorial page, in the body of news articles by paid journalists, and in the offerings of advice and opinion columnists. Misinformation of this nature is a Weeble \u2014 you can hit it, you can knock it down, but as surely as God made little green apples, it will pop back up.  And sure enough, Jesse Jackson\u2019s speech before the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles on 15 August 2000 included this bit of wisdom about the importance of voting:   One vote decided that America would speak English rather than German in 1776. One vote kept Aaron Burr, later charged with treason, from becoming our president. One vote made Texas part of the United States of America in 1845. One vote changed France from a monarchy to a republic. One vote has the power to change our course.   Ann Landers ran the following on 4 November 1996:   DEAR READERS: Tomorrow is Election Day. If you don\u2019t bother to vote, you have no right to complain about who gets elected. The essay that follows was sent in by a reader in Missouri. I hope it will inspire you.  How Important Is One Vote?   In 1645, one vote gave Oliver Cromwell control of England.   In 1649, one vote caused Charles I of England to be executed.   In 1776, one vote gave America the English language instead of German.   In 1845, one vote brought Texas into the Union.   In 1868, one vote saved President Andrew Johnson from impeachment.  In 1875, one vote changed France from a monarchy to a republic.   In 1876, one vote gave Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency of the United States.  In 1923, one vote gave Adolf Hitler leadership of the Nazi Party.   In 1941, one vote saved Selective Service \u2013 just weeks before Pearl Harbor was attacked.     When Ann Landers\u2019 readers started flooding her mailbox with \u201cyou wuz wrong\u201d notes, she printed their comments in her 30 December 1996 column:   Dear Ann Landers: I\u2019m no historian, but that essay in your column about one vote preserving English as our official language is a myth that refuses to die. There NEVER was a possibility that German would be the official language of the United States, nor was there a vote on such a measure. The Library of Congress first began to receive queries about this during the late 1930s, when Nazi propagandists were hard at work trying to convince the world that America had almost been a German-speaking country. That story gained such momentum over the years that the Congressional Research Service looked into it in 1982. Here\u2019s what happened: In 1794 some German settlers in Virginia petitioned the U.S. Congress to have certain federal statutes translated into German and printed in both languages. This petition was referred to a committee, which voted the idea down \u2013 by a margin of one vote. Please stomp out that piece of fiction whenever you encounter it. Support your local responsible historian. Lewiston, Maine Dear Lewiston: Thank you for helping to set the record straight.         [Even the lad who was setting Ann Landers straight got a bit of the explanation wrong. The claim \u201cThis petition was referred to a committee, which voted the idea down \u2013 by a margin of one vote\u201d isn\u2019t right. Nothing got voted down; the measure that was defeated was a petition to adjourn. By the way, in case Lewiston\u2019s explanation wasn\u2019t perfectly clear, the German language fracas was over a proposal brought by a group of German-Americans from Virginia who were asking that a printing run of 3,000 sets of laws also be translated into German for the benefit of the German-speaking folks they represented. Our German Vote page explains this more clearly than constraints of space allow for here. Now let\u2019s get back to Ann\u2019s response.]   Methinks when early American history was taught in school, I was out to lunch. Read on for some other interesting tidbits:     Dear Ann: You printed that \u201cin 1868, one vote saved President Andrew Johnson from impeachment.\u201d Actually, \u201cimpeachment\u201d means a public official has been charged with a crime. Andrew Johnson was not saved from that. However, he was not convicted because the Senate was one vote shy of the two-thirds necessary. Thought you\u2019d want to know.  \u2013 Gail in Bartow, Fla.     Dear Ann: Oliver Cromwell did not gain control of England by one vote. Parliament dissolved itself without even taking a vote. That wasn\u2019t the only error in your column about the importance of one vote. On the day King Charles I of England was sentenced to death, no vote was taken, but 59 commissioners eventually signed his death warrant. Texas was brought into the Union by a Senate vote of 27 to 25 and a House vote of 132 to 75. And finally, Adolf Hitler became dictator of the Nazi Party in 1921, not 1923. And the vote was 553 to 1.   \u2013 Madison, Wis. Dear Madison: I want to thank all who wrote about the importance of one vote. Did you know that in the last presidential election, fewer than half the people eligible to vote turned out? This is a sad commentary when one considers how many people have fought and died for the privilege.   Ten years earlier Ann\u2019s sister, Abigail van Buren, was given a similar list by one of her readers, ran with it, and also received a flood of mail setting her straight.    [Dear Abby, 23 March 1986] Dear Abby: In a recent column you emphasized the importance of voting. May I share with your readers some examples of how one vote changed history?   In 1645, ONE VOTE gave Oliver Cromwell control of England.   In 1649, ONE VOTE caused Charles I of England to be executed.   In 1839, ONE VOTE elected Marcus Morton governor of Massachusetts.   In 1845, ONE VOTE brought Texas into the Union.   In 1868, ONE VOTE saved President Andrew Johnson from impeachment.   In 1876, ONE VOTE changed France from a monarchy to a republic.   In 1923, ONE VOTE gave Adolf Hitler leadership of the Nazi Party.   In 1960, ONE VOTE change in each precinct in Illinois would have defeated John F. Kennedy.   James W. Anderson Talladega, Ala.   Like Ann\u2019s, Abby\u2019s readers reacted by sending in corrections. Here\u2019s one of Abby\u2019s columns of those letters:   [Dear Abby, 12 May 1986] 1 MAN, 1 VOTE \u2014 AND MANY ERRORS Dear Abby: I would like to comment about the letter from an Alabama reader who gave examples of \u201chow one vote changed history.\u201d His purpose, to encourage voting, was a good one, but most of his facts were wrong. He said: \u201cIn 1645, one vote gave Oliver Cromwell control of England.\u201d Wrong! In 1645, Oliver Cromwell became leader of the New Model (Puritan) Army, but not of England, which was then in the midst of a civil war. He didn\u2019t establish his own government until 1649 \u2013 and then did so in part by expelling opponents from Parliament. It wasn\u2019t primarily votes but strong leadership and military force that established his control. He said: \u201cIn 1649, one vote caused King Charles of England to be executed.\u201d Wrong! In 1649, King Charles I of England was executed \u2013 but not as a result of a one-vote margin. Cromwell\u2019s soldiers excluded the moderate majority from the House of Commons and shut down the pro-royalist House of Lords entirely; a newly established revolutionary tribunal then tried the king and overwhelmingly condemned him to death. He stated: \u201cIn 1845, one vote brought Texas into the Union.\u201d Wrong! In 1845, the U.S. Senate passed the convention annexing Texas by two votes (27-25), not one; and it entered into force only after ratification by the Texas Congress and voters. He stated: \u201cIn 1876, one vote changed France from a monarchy to a republic.\u201d                        Wrong! In 1876, France was not a monarchy; it had become a republic in 1875, by a larger margin. (Its empire had ended in 1870; previous monarchies ended in 1830 and 1848.) He stated: \u201cIn 1923, one vote gave Adolf Hitler leadership of the Nazi Party.\u201d Wrong! Hitler acquired dictatorial control of the Nazi Party in 1921, not 1923, and by a party congress vote of 553-1 \u2013 not exactly a one-vote margin. Abby, if your Alabama correspondent wanted his argument to be effective, he should have checked his facts. Louise E. Hoffman, Ph.D. Dear Dr. Hoffman: I was hesitant to publish his letter without checking his facts, but he seemed so cotton pickin\u2019 sure, I didn\u2019t question his sources. My fault, not his.   Our earliest print sighting (so far) dates to 1979, where it appeared in a collection of anecdotes and talking points:         Suppose we scan the pages of history to see some of the great issues which were one or lost by one vote. Oliver Cromwell won control of England in 1645, when Parliament voted 91 to 90 in his favor. King Charles I was beheaded on the basis of the judges\u2019 vote of 68 to 67. France changed from a monarchy to a republic in 1875. The vote of the deputies was 353 to 352. During the American Revolution, anti-British sentiment was high in many colonies. A bill was presented to the Continental Congress which would have abolished English as the official American language in favor of German. The bill was defeated by one vote. In 1845, the Senate voted 26 to 25 to admit Texas to the union. Indiana\u2019s Senator Hannigan changed his mind and voted in favor of its admission. And, the senator himself had won his election to office by only one vote! President Andrew Johnson escaped impeachment in 1868 by one vote. Rutherford B. Hayes was elected President of the United States in 1876 by an electoral vote of 185 to 184. On November 8, 1923, the leaders of the tiny Nazi party met in a Munich tavern and elected Adolf Hitler as their leader \u2014 by a margin of one vote. What disastrous world war might have been averted if that group had elected a different man!   Some claims from the \u201cone vote\u201d laundry lists have something to them, namely:   Andrew Johnson retained his office by one vote. The final tally against him was 35 to 19, but a two-thirds majority of the votes cast was needed to oust him from office, thus a 36-to-18 result was required. Gail in Bartow, Fla., was right, though.  The vote was not to impeach Johnson (which had already been done); the vote was to remove him from office. Folks have come to think of these terms as interchangeable, but they\u2019re not.  (President Clinton was recently impeached, but he was not removed from office either.)  In 1839, Marcus \u201cLandslide\u201d Morton was indeed elected governor of Massachusetts by one vote. Of the 102,066 votes cast by the good people of that state, he received exactly 51,034. Had his count been 51,033, the election would have been thrown into the Legislature, where he probably would not have won.  \u201cLandslide\u201d also made the record books in 1842 when he won the same office again by one vote, this time in the Legislature. (In those days, Massachusetts governors were elected for terms of one year.)  And some of the claims made have something to them, but should be dismissed anyway:   Rutherford B. Hayes was elected President in 1876 by one vote, but it was due to election chicanery and backroom deal-making and thus should not be counted as an honestly arrived-at result. Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote by a quarter million votes and came up one electoral vote shy of a majority because twenty electoral votes were under dispute. A Congressionally-appointed commission composed of eight Republicans and seven Democrats voted along party lines, awarding all twenty of those disputed votes to Hayes.  In 1941, the active-service component of the Selective Service Act of 1940 was extended by a margin of one vote, 203 to 202. The original act provided that a drafted man should serve for one year and then spend ten years in the reserves, subject to call-up in case of war. The amendment lengthened every draftee\u2019s service from one year to two-and-a-half years. This close vote didn\u2019t save Selective Service from being axed; what was voted on was how long a draftee would have to serve if called up. Had the amendment been defeated, the original act would have remained in force; there was no expiry date on it, and nothing needed to be renewed to keep it going. No one knows where the \u201cjust weeks before Pearl Harbor was attacked\u201d element enters into things. The vote was held in August 1941, four months before Pearl Harbor.  And some claims we\u2019ll never get to the bottom of:   Adolph Hitler resigned from the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party (NSDAP) in July 1921.  He allowed himself to be coaxed into rejoining shortly afterwards with the demand that he be given \u201cthe post of chairman with dictatorial power.\u201d  The party membership soon voted 553 to 1 in favor of taking Hitler back on his terms.  How anyone could claim this was a \u201cone vote\u201d election is mystifying.  A one vote change in each precinct in Illinois would not have defeated John F. Kennedy in 1960. In the 1960 presidential election, John F. Kennedy bested Richard Nixon by a mere 118,000 popular votes (out of 68 million ballots cast), and Kennedy also won the state of Illinois by a margin of less than 9,000 votes.  However, the key electoral vote total wasn\u2019t nearly as close as the popular vote: Kennedy came out ahead of Nixon by a 303 to 219 margin, so even if Nixon had taken Illinois (and its 27 electoral votes), Kennedy would still have won a majority in the electoral college. Even the charge that a one vote difference in each precinct in Illinois would have changed that state\u2019s results is hard to prove or disprove because it\u2019s widely understood there was a fair bit of cheating carried out by both sides over those 27 electoral votes. What the numbers eventually tallied out to be is almost immaterial, as both Nixon\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s factions were reportedly stuffing every ballot box in sight. That year, the motto in Illinois seemed to be: \u201cOne man, one vote \u2013 and then some.\u201d A statement from Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley captured the essence of what was going on in that place and time: \u201cOne of their precincts, outside of Peoria, where there are only 50 votes, just announced 500 votes for Nixon.\u201d         In closing, here\u2019s a real \u201cone vote\u201d story that\u2019s not on anybody\u2019s list, though it should be:   On 18 January 1961, in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), the Afro-Shirazi Party won the general elections by a single seat, after the seat of Chake-Chake on Pemba Island was won by a single vote.

    "content": " Claim:   Italian dictator Benito Mussolini made the trains run on time.  Status:   False.  Origins:   Every political leader \u2014 whether he be a democratically elected representative or a usurping tyrant \u2014 seeks to gain broad public support, because the greater his support, the greater his power.  That power may ultimately be used for good or for bad, but either way it must be obtained before it can be wielded. One         of the best ways to gain the support of the people you want to lead is to do something of benefit to them.  Failing that, the next best thing is to convince them that you have done something of benefit to them, even though you really haven\u2019t.  So it was with Benito Mussolini and the Italian railway system. After the \u201cmarch on Rome\u201d (which was itself a myth of fascist propaganda) on 28 October 1922 that resulted in King Vittorio Emanuele\u2019s appointment of Benito Mussolini as prime minister and the accession to power of the fascists in Italy, Mussolini needed to convince the people of Italy that fascism was indeed a system that worked to their benefit.  Thus was born the myth of fascist efficiency, with the train as its symbol.  The word was spread that Mussolini had turned the dilapidated Italian railway system into one that was the envy of all Europe, featuring trains that were both dependable and punctual.  In Mussolini\u2019s Italy, all the trains ran on  time. Well, not quite.  The Italian railway system had fallen into a rather sad state during World War I, and it did improve a good deal during the 1920s, but Mussolini was disingenuous in taking credit for the changes: much of the repair work had been performed before Mussolini and the fascists came to power in 1922.  More importantly (to the claim at hand), those who actually lived in Italy during the Mussolini era have borne testimony that the Italian railway\u2019s legendary adherence to timetables was far more myth than reality. The myth of Mussolini\u2019s punctual trains lives on, albeit with a different slant: rather than serving as a fictitious symbol of the benefits of fascism, it is now offered as a sardonic example that something good can result even from the worst of circumstances.  As Montagu and Darling wrote:    Mussolini may have done many brutal and tyrannical things; he may have destroyed human freedom in Italy; he may have murdered and tortured citizens whose only crime was to oppose Mussolini; but \u2018one had to admit\u2019 one thing about the Dictator: he \u2018made the trains run on time.\u2019   No, thanks.  I\u2019d rather walk. Sightings:   In an episode of televisions L.A. Law (\u201cRomancing the Drone,\u201d originally aired 17 November 1988), Michael Kuzak answers Grace Van Owen\u2019s criticism with \u201cAnd Mussolini made the trains run on time.\u201d       Last updated:   29 September 2007         Sources:       Montagu, Ashley and Edward Darling.

    "claim": "The U.S. Postal Service is discontinuing the Black Heritage series of postage stamps and destroying the remaining stock.",
    "content": " A significant subset of the e-mail forwards we receive consists of expressions of the theme that blacks are being overlooked and slighted by white Americans, particularly in the economic arena. A common feature of such messages are claims that major companies decline to advertise in media that reach primarily black audiences (because those businesses fail to recognize both the social desires and income levels of black Americans) and that the roles of blacks in American history have been ignored or minimized. Examples: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] Subject: Discontinuing and DESTROYING Black Stamps I was in the post office this morning and requested the African American stamp. The postal worker informed me that they will DESTROY all remaining African American Heritage stamps at the end of the month instead of following their usual process of selling them until they are depleted. She also said that they were asking patrons to complain to the Post Master and gave me a complaint form. Needless to say, I\u2019ve already completed the form. The post office is considering discontinuing Black Heritage Stamps because they aren\u2019t selling. Instead of taking the path of least resistance and accepting the love, flag, rose or teddy bear stamps that they offer you automatically, request African-American stamps each and every time you mail something. If we don\u2019t buy them, nobody will. Perhaps you think it\u2019s not a major issue. However, it is a part of the ongoing effort to assert ourselves as a major economic force in this society. PASS THE MESSAGE ON AND LET\u2019S KEEP BLACK STAMPS IN CIRCULATION.    [Collected via e-mail, 2007] US POST OFFICE TO DESTROY AFRICAN AMERICAN STAMPS! Thurgood Marshall, Roy Wilkins, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Patricia Roberts Harris are all on these stamps. Please forward this and buy a book of our stamps ASAP. The P.O. will DESTROY all remaining African American Heritage stamps at the end of the month instead of following their usual procedure of selling them until they are depleted. Why? Because we\u2019re not buying them! However, our postal workers are asking patrons to complain to the Post Master, via a complaint form. Please ask for and complete the form (at the post office). Skip the love, flag, rose or teddy-bear stamps that they offer you automatically, request African-American stamps every time. If we don\u2019t buy them, nobody will. We need to keep the little things that we do get. Please send this email to all your friends so we can keep BLACK STAMPS in circulation!!!! This current message touches on both these themes \u2014 postage stamps honoring the heritage and contributions of Black Americans are being discontinued and destroyed for the most basic of economic reasons: because people don\u2019t buy them. In this particular case, however, those feelings are misplaced: the United States Postal Service (USPS) is neither discontinuing the Black Heritage series of postage stamps nor planning to destroy the remaining stock of those issues. The series has been going strong ever since 1978, and the 2007 stamp (the 30th entry in the series) features singer Ella Fitzgerald. There is no end to the Black Heritage series in sight no matter how well or poorly any of its individual stamps sell, but rumors claiming that the series is in danger of discontinuation due to low sales--> have been circulating since at least 2000, when Executive Director of Stamp Services Azeezaly S. Jaffer issued an official USPS media statement disclaiming those rumors: Given the popularity and importance of the Black Heritage stamps, there are no plans to discontinue the series. It is unfortunate that such rumors have spread, and we hope that the Postal Service\u2019s commitment to honoring the historical achievements and contributions of African Americans on stamps will dispel any further concerns[.]       This policy was confirmed yet again by the USPS in a March 2005 press release: To dispel recurring rumors that its long-standing Black Heritage stamp series will be discontinued, a senior postal official reiterated the Postal Service\u2019s continued commitment to honoring African Americans on stamps.\u201dNothing could be further from the truth. These rumors continue to resurface around this time of year,\u201d explained David Failor, Executive Director of Stamp Services, U.S. Postal Service, referring to the deluge of inquiries the Postal Service receives shortly after a Black Heritage stamp issuance. He said, \u201cAs a main component of our annual stamp program, the Black Heritage series is alive and well, and here to stay. We\u2019re already looking forward to announcing next year\u2019s honoree this fall.\u201d The myth started several years ago through an anonymous email that alerted recipients to buy Black Heritage stamps before Post Offices take them off sale due to lack of demand. In 2007 the USPS confirmed yet again that not only are Black Heritage stamps being neither discontinued nor destroyed, but that the series is one of its most popular issues: A recent Internet rumor saying the Postal Service is discontinuing the Black Heritage series is another one of those untrue yarns that the Internet is sometimes famous for, as is the rumor that the Postal Service is destroying current Black Heritage series stamps.The fact is that the Black Heritage stamp series is one of our most popular. We have no plans whatsoever to discontinue it. The Postal Service remains as strongly committed to honoring the historical achievements and contributions of African Americans on stamps as we\u2019ve always been. And we are proud to offer the latest stamp in the series honoring the great civil rights advocate and Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall. Exhorting people to buy Black Heritage stamps as a way of honoring the memories of the individuals they depict (and black Americans in general) is a worthy cause; such efforts need not be based on misinformation to succeed.
