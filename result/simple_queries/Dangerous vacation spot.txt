    "title": "Is Jacob\u2019s Well a Dangerous Vacation Spot in California?",

    "claim": "From an internet advertisement: \"No One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\"",
    "content": " In late 2020, an online advertisement that appeared to be clickbait showed a girl jumping into what looked like a vertical hole in a lake. The photograph of what turned out to be Jacob\u2019s Well included the text: \u201cNo One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\u201d The image was real, but it had nothing to do with the state of California. Jacob\u2019s Well is a popular destination for swimming in Hays County, Texas. It is the second-largest fully submerged cave in the state. The image of Jacob\u2019s Well had also appeared on Reddit and Pinterest in the past. We were unable to find the name of the photographer.  Internet advertisements that include phrases like \u201cyou won\u2019t believe what happens next\u201d and \u201cdoctors hate him\u201d have dominated the online landscape for years, often failing to deliver on their promises, and leaving readers clicking through endless slideshows with no payoff. The advertisement that claimed \u201cno one realizes how dangerous this popular vacation spot in California actually is\u201d was hosted by Outbrain, and the landing page after clicking the advertisement went to Icepop. Outbrain facilitated the technology that allowed Icepop to run the advertisement. However, Icepop created the content. Icepop\u2019s strategy appeared to be what has become known as advertising arbitrage. We described arbitrage in a previous story that falsely claimed \u201cJeopardy\u201d host Alex Trebek\u2019s net worth \u201cleft his family in tears\u201d following his passing. The basic idea is to make more money by displaying advertisements on each Icepop slideshow page than it had cost to run the Outbrain advertisement that led readers to the slideshow in the first place.       In the case of Jacob\u2019s Well, it appeared on page two of the slideshow, which is quite early compared to other instances of arbitrage. However, the image was quite different than the one that appeared in the advertisement, and since it did not feature California, Icepop\u2019s strategy for the advertisement may have been to keep readers clicking until they found the image from the advertisement. The image from the advertisement did not make an appearance in the slideshow story. The Hays County website described the history of Jacob\u2019s Well, including how it earned the name: Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area consists of five land surveys that all use the spring as a corner to tie the properties together. These surveys were conducted in 1847 by a prominent surveyor names Bartlett Sims. In the early 1850\u2019s William C. Winters, a San Jacinto veteran and early settler of Wimberley, hiked up Cypress Creek searching for its source and found an overflowing spring. It is said that Mr. Winters exclaimed \u201clike unto a well in Bible times.\u201d Thus it was named \u2018Jacob\u2019s Well\u2019. The property changed hands many times over the next 100 years and became a popular recreational destination. Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area remains a popular recreational destination today. The county also noted that the deepest part of the cavern system is 140 feet deep, and that the main cavern length is 4,341 feet. Wimberley Valley Watershed published an informative video on Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area, which included details on its Native American history. It is true that a handful of people have drowned at Jacob\u2019s Well, but it is false that \u201cno one realizes how dangerous\u201d it is. On top of Jacob\u2019s Well being featured on Reddit and Pinterest, tales of its dangers also appeared in San Antonio Express-News, Discovery, Swimmer\u2019s Daily, All That\u2019s Interesting, and others. On Nov. 26, 1983, an Associated Press story was published in Salisbury, Maryland\u2019s, The Daily Times. It detailed a number of drownings at Jacob\u2019s Well:        In 1984, Wayne W. Russell, Jr. became the ninth fatality at Jacob\u2019s Well. Treehugger linked to a particularly frightening video that purported to show someone freediving around 100 feet (30 meters) into the water without scuba gear.      A Reddit post claimed to show a sign near the entrance to the cave below where swimmers jump into the water.  However, that sign didn\u2019t appear in any diving videos, and may have been shot at Eagle\u2019s Next Sinkhole in Florida, where multiple people have died in the past. The sign also appeared in a YouTube video from a cave dive in Mexico. In sum, Jacob\u2019s Well is a real and dangerous tourist attraction that has led to multiple drownings in the past. However, it\u2019s false to say that it\u2019s located in California, and also not true that \u201cno one\u201d is aware of its dangers. Hays County announced on its parks department phone line that Jacob\u2019s Well would be closed for the remainder of 2020 for \u201caquatic restoration,\u201d and would not reopen for swimming until May 2021. Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages. It\u2019s called advertising \u201carbitrage.\u201d The advertiser\u2019s goal is to make more money on ads displayed on the slideshow\u2019s pages than it cost to show the initial ad that lured them to it.

    "claim": "The Obamas had their dog, Bo, flown on his own airplane to join them on vacation.",
    "content": " In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was dogged by a false rumor that he had accidentally left his Scottish terrier, Fala, behind during a trip to the Aleutian Islands and had ordered a U.S. Navy destroyer to the islands solely to retrieve his pooch \u2014 at a cost of millions of dollars to U.S. taxpayers. In a famous speech, Roosevelt deftly used humor to puncture his political opponents and deflate the rumor, saying:  You know Fala is Scotch, and being a Scotty, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers, in Congress and out,  had concocted a story that I\u2019d left him behind on an Aleutian island and had sent a destroyer back to find him, at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three or eight or twenty million dollars, his Scotch soul was furious \u2026 He has not been the same dog since.  In July 2010, a similar rumor attached to another Democratic president, Barack Obama, when an unfounded claim was circulated stating that the Obamas\u2019 family pup, a Portuguese water dog named Bo, had been flown out to Maine on his own plane (i.e., on a flight arranged for no purpose other than transporting a dog) so he could be on hand to greet the First Family when they arrived in that state for a weekend vacation:  BO\u2019S VACATION IN MASSACHUSETTS I guess since they had to swallow their pride and use the Gulfstream there just wasn\u2019t enough room for the dog and one other person on Air Force One. Did you know that President Barack Hussein Obama flew Bo, their dog, in on a separate smaller jet to Massachusetts for their vacation? I wonder if that sets well with all the unemployed, hurting, U S citizens who can\u2019t afford food, but we can pay for this. The above is true.  This rumor was based on a single sentence in a Waterville, Maine, newspaper article about the Obamas\u2019 visit, which was misinterpreted to mean that Bo had flown on a plane accompanied only by a single handler:  Arriving in a small jet before the Obamas was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U.S. Sen Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.; and the president\u2019s personal aide Reggie Love, who chatted with [Gov. John] Baldacci.        Bo flew to Maine in a different plane than the rest of the First Family not because he was part of a special canine-only flight, but because the local airport (Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton, Maine) was too small to accommodate the Boeing 747-200B in which the President usually travels.  Therefore, the Obamas flew to Maine in a Gulfstream GIII/G3 jet (which seats six to nineteen passengers), while Bo was loaded onto an earlier flight which carried a contingent of presidential aides and staff members.   The Waterville Morning Sentinel later added an amplification to their original article about the Obamas\u2019 visit, noting that:  Today\u2019s story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obama\u2019s dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president\u2019s usual jet.  Similar claims were trotted out again during the First Family\u2019s vacation at Martha\u2019s Vineyard in August 2013, when articles (such as a Telegraph piece entitled \u201cFirst Dog Bo Is Airlifted to Obama Holiday Home\u201d) were misleadingly proffered as proof that Bo was flown from Washington to the Obamas\u2019 Massachusetts vacation spot on his very own Marine helicopter.   The truth is that President Obama\u2019s 747-200B aircraft did not land at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Airport when he traveled there; instead, it touched down at nearby Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, and the presidential party was then flown the short distance to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Airport via helicopter.  In August 2013 Bo simply flew the last leg of the trip, from Cape Cod to Martha\u2019s Vineyard (a distance of about six miles), ahead of the Obamas on a helicopter that was already ferrying presidential aides, reporters, and baggage to the latter destination:  President Obama arrived on the Vineyard late Saturday afternoon to begin an eight-day summer vacation with his family. Air Force One touched down at Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod in Bourne at 3.24 p.m. Saturday. Marine One touched down at the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Airport just before 4 p.m. carrying President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Two Osprey MV-22 helicopters landed ahead of time with staff and press. The president and First Lady left Marine One and boarded a black car. Two white mesh bags full of basketballs were unloaded from one of the Osprey, and first dog Bo also traveled on [one of the] Osprey. He waited patiently on the tarmac with a handler.    IN THE MUSLIM RELIGION, DOGS ARE UNCLEAN AND NOT ALLOWED TO TRAVEL IN THE SAME VEHICLE AS THE MUSLIM. Bo has never traveled in the same means of transportation with the First Family.   Bo has most certainly traveled with the First Family. Here are a representative group of news articles that mention the dog's being with them:   \"As the president and his family headed to Martha's Vineyard &mdash; after a brief delay while a weakening Hurricane Bill swept past the island &mdash; a surprise visitor ambled through the media cabin on Air Force One: Bo, the first dog.\"  Vacation Time for the First Family Michael Shear, Washington Post, 24 August 2009.   \"Obama made a surprise visit to the press cabin of Air Force One with the furry pooch, but like his owner, the pup quickly headed back to the front of the plane. The president, wearing shirtsleeves and a broad smile, watched as Bo walked up and down the aisle collecting pats from reporters.\"  First Return Trip in a Year Carol Lee, Politico, 27 May 2010.  \"Then it was off with the [President's] suit and tie, onto Air Force One with first dog Bo, and away for a 10-day break.\"  Slideshow: The Obamas on Vacation The Grio, 20 August 2010.  --> ",

    "claim": "An old camera found in the deep ocean revealed horrifying Titanic photos.",
    "content": " The history of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 has been plagued by tall tales, conspiracy theories, and urban legends. The Titanic\u2019s story perhaps became more popular than ever with James Cameron\u2019s release of the 1997 blockbuster epic of the same name. Speaking of Cameron, even the film\u2019s shooting was marked by a questionable occurrence, in which a chef on set laced the seafood chowder with PCP, causing some cast and crew to be sick. Since at least November 2020, an advertisement promoted on the Taboola advertising platform read: \u201cOld Camera Found In The Deep Ocean Reveals Horrifying Titanic Photos.\u201d A website, Floor8, appeared to take a frame from the 1997 film and change it to appear black and white. The advertisement was placed by Floor8, and clicking on it led curious readers to a Floor8 story with a title different than the advertisement: \u201cHere\u2019s What the Last Days of the Titanic Were Really Like.\u201d The story was originally published by Two Red Dots, and mentioned nothing about an \u201cold camera\u201d being \u201cfound in the deep ocean.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Two Red Dots was related to Floor8. This is what\u2019s known as advertising arbitrage. The strategy is to provide something interesting in the advertisement, often something that is highly misleading, and then to land readers on a slideshow-style story where they must click sometimes hundreds of times to finish the slideshow. The advertisers aim to make more money on the slideshow clicks than they spent to advertise the story in the first place. We previously covered other stories about arbitrage, including one that falsely said Alex Trebek\u2019s family was \u201cin tears\u201d after they saw his net worth following his death, another that claimed a dangerous vacation spot was in California (it wasn\u2019t), and yet another that misled readers into believing former actress and model Evelyn Nesbit was part of Wild West history. The remaining wreckage from the Titanic was estimated to be 12,600 feet (3,840 meters) underwater. Had a camera from the early 20th century been recovered near the ocean floor after around 100 years, the images could certainly not be recovered. While an old camera with \u201chorrifying Titanic photos\u201d was not found in the deep ocean, it is true that a young girl named Bernice Palmer shot photographs of the iceberg that ripped open the Titanic, resulted in its sinking. She also captured images of survivors. The Natural Museum of American History published that Palmer carried a handheld camera on the ship that responded to the Titanic\u2019s distress call: In 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company came out with the handheld box camera known as the \u201cBrownie.\u201d An immediate hit, more than 100,000 were sold in its first year. Canadian Bernice \u201cBernie\u201d Palmer received a Kodak Brownie box camera, either for Christmas 1911 or for her birthday on January 10th, 1912.     In early April, Bernie and her mother boarded the Cunard liner Carpathia in New York, for a Mediterranean cruise. Carpathia had scarcely cleared New York, when it received a distress call from the White Star liner Titanic on 14 April. It raced to the scene of the sinking and managed to rescue over 700 survivors from the icy North Atlantic. With her new camera, Bernice took pictures of the iceberg that sliced open the Titanic\u2019s hull below the waterline and also took snapshots of some of the Titanic survivors. After arriving back in New York, Palmer was approached by an employee with Underwood &amp; Underwood, a New York photography agency. They negotiated a deal for $10 so that Underwood &amp; Underwood could develop and use the photographs, what the Smithsonian Institution today called \u201ca pittance.\u201d Palmer may not have realized at the time that the pictures would be worth so much more money. Her photographs and the Underwood &amp; Underwood contract can be viewed on the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s website. Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages.

    "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rayban-anniversary-sale/",
    "claim": "Ray-Ban sunglasses are 90% off for 24 hours only in honor of the company's anniversary.",
    "content": " In late May 2021, postings on social media promoted a purported 84th-anniversary sale for Ray-Ban sunglasses. The offer of 90% off supposedly only lasted for 24 hours. Ray-Ban sunglasses cost hundreds of dollars, so such a sale would mean huge savings for consumers. This was not a legitimate offer from Ray-Ban. It is a dangerous scam. It\u2019s been going around for several years, including on Tumblr. How the Scam Works Tweets that promoted the scam read: \u201cFriends, the surprise is coming. Are you interested?\u201d They appeared to involve phishing attempts that pulled follower names from a user\u2019s follower list. This caused the scam to virally spread. The scammers appeared to gain access to social media accounts after users visited the dangerous website that appeared in this image:        We strongly advise against visiting the website. Providing information to scammers could lead to identity theft and other harmful outcomes. The Fake \u2018Official\u2019 Website While the image did say that the scam website was Ray-Ban\u2019s \u201cofficial website,\u201d this was false. The 5-letter website that appeared in the social media postings began with \u201crb,\u201d as in \u201crb\u2014.com.\u201d We have removed the last three letters from the website address so as to not encourage readers to visit the fake website.  This was not an official Ray-Ban website. The official Ray-Ban website is ray-ban.com. The company is owned by Luxottica. As of June 1, 2021, the official Ray-Ban Twitter account had not tweeted about the resurgence of the anniversary sale scam. However, a search for past tweets showed other 5-letter scam websites that also began with \u201crb\u2014.com,\u201d except with other combinations of three letters following \u201crb.\u201d       Anniversary Sale Scams Scammers have often used the ploy that major companies (like Ray-Ban) are having anniversary sales in order to trick consumers into falling into the trap. We\u2019ve reported on a seemingly endless number of these scams in the past. For example, Aldi, Tim Hortons, Taco Bell, and Walmart have all been used in anniversary sale scams, to name a few. We\u2019ve even seen vacation scams on Facebook for getaways to Bora Bora and Las Vegas that may have tricked people into sharing the fake giveaways. In sum, Ray-Ban nor Luxottica is not offering 90% off sunglasses for 24 hours for its 84th anniversary, or any anniversary. ",

    "claim": "Photographs of actress Evelyn Nesbit are accurate representations of \"Wild West\" history.",
    "content": " Evelyn Nesbit, the former actress and model, was featured in an online advertisement that promised: \u201cHistorical Wild West photos \u2013 Discretion Advised.\u201d The ad was placed by a website named Bon Voyaged, and was likely years old. It was spotted as recently as November 2020. As we\u2019ve noted in debunked stories about Alex Trebek\u2019s net worth and a dangerous vacation spot in California, internet advertisements that lead to slideshow lists aren\u2019t exactly credible sources of information. Bon Voyaged used the Outbrain advertising platform to place the advertisement, and the resulting landing page from 2016 was on the Bon Voyaged website. Once readers landed on Bon Voyaged, they were encouraged to click 80 times through a slideshow to see \u201cAmazing Wild West Photos\u201d \u2014 none of which featured Florence Evelyn Nesbit, which was her full name. Nesbit\u2019s Life Nesbit lived from 1884 (or 1885) to 1967. Her birth year is unclear, as spelled out in the book \u201cAmerican Eve: Evelyn Nesbit, Stanford White, the Birth of the \u2018It\u2019 Girl, and the Crime of the Century\u201d by Paula Uruburu, a professor of English and film studies at Hofstra University. Nesbit lived the early years of her life in Pennsylvania, including in Natrona, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, cities that were not part of the so-called Wild West.       Uruburu wrote that Nesbit was photographed in Philadelphia around the age of 14 or 15, which set off a firestorm of interest in her physical appearance: Not long after the suggestion was made, Ryland Phillips, a Philadelphia photographer who had heard from John Storm about the fetching fifteen-year-old, arranged for her to sit for some photographic studies. Or rather stand. Throughout the session, Phillips had Florence Evelyn lean casually against a wall, clad in a floor-length milky white satin gown, with her hair falling softly to one side. Unlike the painters, who preferred her without makeup, however, the photographer put some eye makeup and lipstick on Evelyn, subtle touches that nonetheless gave her a startlingly more mature appearance. Phillips was extraordinarily pleased by the pictures in which, he said, she resembled \u201ca young Aphrodite.\u201d He managed to have them printed in an art magazine, where they attracted a good deal of attention; they were then reproduced in the Philadelphia newspapers (and once again a year or two later in \u201cBroadway Magazine\u201d). Nesbit then moved to New York City, where she became an \u201covernight success.\u201d The \u201cWild West\u201d Photograph In 1901, she posed for the picture that, more than a century later, was used in the 2020 internet advertisement from Bon Voyaged:  It appeared to be a photograph from Otto Sarony\u2019s studio. Uruburu noted that Sarony\u2019s work was mostly theatrical subjects. Some of his studio\u2019s photographs are still available today on eBay. This cabinet card appeared to show another photograph taken during the same session.        In author Jim Alessio\u2019s book, \u201cThe Eternal Flapper: The Many Lives of Edna Wallace Hopper,\u201d he wrote that Otto Sarony and his father, Napoleon Sarony, \u201cmass-marketed\u201d their images, and unaccredited photographers actually shot the photographs. Sarony Studio dominated the theatrical portraiture market during the last half of the 19th century, remained a power in theater publicity circles until the mid-1920s, and a viable brand as a portrait studio until late in the 20th century. [Napoleon] proved to be the most enterprising celebrity photographer of the post-Civil War era. His studio on Fifth Avenue, a famously extravagant temple of odd props, old art, and stuffed exotic wildlife, hosted sittings with the important personages of the era. \u201cThe Trial of the Century\u201d Nesbit\u2019s life was marked by a love triangle, murder, and the \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d Uruburu was asked by PBS\u2019s \u201cAmerican Experience\u201d why people are still so fascinated with Nesbit\u2019s story. She answered: \u201cIt has all the elements \u2014 sex and violence, love and betrayal, a teen-aged girl involved with a married man, an insanely jealous husband driven to murder. Moreover, it involves a supremely beautiful girl who was an icon of her age, the fall of the rich and powerful, the cult of celebrity that is now so familiar, but which at the time was brand new.\u201d In the early 20th century, Nesbit\u2019s image had been used in advertising campaigns to draw in revenue, including for a lumber company. Uruburu wrote in her book: \u201cFlorence Evelyn was dubbed the \u2018modern Helen\u2019 by one columnist, and her evocative and soon familiar face launched any number of advertising campaigns as canny entrepreneurs began to capitalize on her uncanny ability to appeal to both sexes and appear chaste and alluring at the same time.\u201d More than 100 years later, advertisers still appeared to be using Nesbit\u2019s image for revenue. Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages.

    "content": " Photographs that seemingly show small children being placed in danger or present in dangerous situations typically generate much outrage on social media, as exemplified by September 2018 Facebook post that seemingly showed a woman snorting cocaine at a table with her toddler, the latter with credit card in hand:   This post drew thousands of irate comments from viewers, ranging from criticism of the mother (\u201cI pray AND hope this is FAKE, CPS WILL TAKE THE BABY, AND MOMMIE DEAREST DOING A LONG VACATION\u201d) to the photographer who snapped the picture (\u201cAgain some stupid f*ck taking pictures with their almighty cell phone and posting it to social media instead of calling the police or social services\u201d). Of course, plenty of Facebook users also guessed that the photograph was a staged prank or otherwise faked one (although that didn\u2019t necessarily make it less outrageous to many of them).  They were right on the former account, as this image originated with actor/comedian Janell Lenfert, who had posted it to her own Facebook page over three years earlier as a joke along with the comment, \u201cIf you need a babysitter, please let me know!\u201d:  Ms. Lenfert told us by email that:  I don\u2019t have any kids!  That is my best friend\u2019s son and my Godson who I love very very much and intend on giving him this picture when he\u2019s older as a joke!  That is baking flour we used in the picture and this is actually 1 of 4 pictures we did in a series called \u201cbad babysitting photos\u201d as a joke to surprise his mom/my best friend!! She thought they were hilarious!  Anyway, it\u2019s not real of course.  It\u2019s comedy!  Hope this helps people sleep at night.  ",

    "content": " Claim:   Two roommates remain at their deserted college dormitory over a holiday break. One of the girls goes out on a date that evening, and the other one turns in and goes to bed before her roommate returns. Later that night the sleeping girl is awakened by gurgling and scratching noises coming from outside the hallway door. Frightened, she locks the door and cowers inside the room until morning. When the girl finally opens the door and ventures outside, she discovers the bloody corpse of her roommate in the hallway. The murdered girl\u2019s throat had been slit, and she had bled to death in the hallway while clawing at the door.   LEGEND  Example:   [Brunvand, 1965]        These two girls in Corbin had stayed late over Christmas vacation. One of them had to wait for a later train, and the other wanted to go to a fraternity party given that night of vacation. The dorm assistant was in her room \u2014 sacked out. They waited and waited for the intercom, and then they heard this knocking and knocking outside in front of the dorm. So the girl thought it was her date and she went down. But she didn\u2019t come back and she didn\u2019t come back. So real late that night this other girl heard a scratching and gasping down the hall. She couldn\u2019t lock the door, so she locked herself in the closet. In the morning she let herself out and her roommate had had her throat cut, and if the other girl had opened to door earlier, she would have been saved.         Variations:   The   reason why the girls stay alone in the dormitory varies (e.g., they live too far away to go home).   The frightened roommate sometimes hides in the closet (and hears the scratching noises coming from outside the closet door).   In some variations the dead girl\u2019s fingernails are described as having been ground down to bloody stumps.   The frightened roommate\u2019s hair turns white overnight from shock in some versions.   Origins:        Like several similar adolescent horror stories (e.g., The Hook, The Boyfriend\u2019s Death), this story first appeared in the early 1960s.  As with the Campus Halloween Murders legend, this tale may have originated with what Bronner describes as \u201cthe mistrust of the security of institutional life \u2014 especially for students away from the haven of  home \u2014 and the setting of many campuses in isolated arcadias . . .\u201d  As colleges eased the restrictions of dormitory life and took a much less active role in their students\u2019 personal lives, students came to see campuses as \u201cmore open but less protected\u201d places, sites \u201cpotentially open to dangerous strangers.\u201d Last updated:   30 June 2011   Sources:             Bronner, Simon J.

    "claim": "A photograph shows a security wall outside Joe Kennedy's Palm Beach house.",
    "content": " One of the most salient moments from Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s (D-Mass.) response to State of the Union address came when he rebuked President Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the Mexican border in an attempt to stop illegal immigration: America, we carry that story on our shoulders. [\u2026] You probably marched together last weekend, thousands deep, on the streets of Las Vegas and Philadelphia and Nashville. You sat high atop your mom\u2019s shoulders and held a sign that read \u201cBuild a wall and my generation will tear it down.\u201d Some attempted to paint Kennedy as hypocritical for this comment by passing around a photograph purportedly showing \u201cJoe Kennedy\u2019s House\u201d and the security wall that protected it:  There are a number of problems with using this photograph to paint Kennedy as a hypocrite for promising to tear down a border wall.        Chiefly, this is not Joe Kennedy\u2019s house, and hasn\u2019t been in the Kennedy family\u2019s holdings for more than 20 years. This property was purchased by Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., Joe Kennedy III\u2019s great grandfather, in 1933, but the property hasn\u2019t been in the Kennedy family for more than two decades. The Kennedy family sold the property in 1995, when Kennedy III was just 14 years old, according to the New York Times:  The Kennedy days in Palm Beach quietly ended today with the sale of the oceanfront property that Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. bought in 1933 as a vacation spot and that later became his son\u2019s winter White House and eventually a symbol of the family\u2019s troubles. Claiming that the pictured wall was designed to keep people off the property is also misleading. Kennedy\u2019s critics may be under the impression that a wall\u2019s sole purpose is to keep immigrants from crossing a border, but walls have several other purposes\u2014especially in coastal Florida, where hurricanes are known to wreak havoc. In this case, this wall is a seawall designed to keep the ocean, not undocumented immigrants, from damaging the property.  This house is located on Palm Beach, just a few feet from the ocean. A view of the property from Google Earth shows that a sea wall also protects neighboring properties:  It\u2019s true that this photograph shows a wall outside of a house. However, this house does not belong to Joe Kennedy III (and hasn\u2019t been owned by his family since 1995) and the pictured wall is a sea wall, not a border wall, designed to protect the house from the ocean tides.

    "content": "  Claim:    A burgled honeymoon couple gets a shock after developing the film left in their camera.  LEGEND        Example:   [Collected via e-mail, 1997]  A couple from Des Moines were vacationing in Jamaica. One day, upon returning the rented condo they had been staying at, they found that they had been robbed. The thieves had made off with most of their possessions, but the couple were pleased to discover that their camera was still there. When they got home a few days later, and developed the roll of film still in the camera, there were pictures of two Black strangers in the condo in Jamaica, each with a toothbrush up their bums. The couple was horrified when they realized those were their toothbrushes.      Origins:   This well-traveled urban legend has been with us since at least 1990. Most often told of happening to a couple on their honeymoon, this legend has versions which also identify the victims as a generic married couple on vacation, a lone traveller, a pair of young women, or even a roomful of college guys.  As often as the victims\u2019 identities change, so does the locale. Jamaica is the popular choice, but this tale has also been set in the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Mexico,         Costa Rica, New York City, Las Vegas, Hawaii, the southern United States and Europe (usually Rome, Paris or the French Riviera).  The \u201cewww!\u201d factor of this story comes from the belief the couple continued to make use of their toothbrushes after the break-in, realizing only when their photos come back from the lab what they\u2019d been putting in their mouths all that time. Interestingly enough, though it\u2019s rarely specified as such in any of the tellings, most people assume the brushes were inserted into the miscreants\u2019 rears bristle-ends first. If this was indeed the orientation of the implements, this leads to the first improbability of the story: would anyone examining a photograph of something sticking out of a naked bum immediately identify that object as a toothbrush from seeing only the handle end?   Another improbability is the notion of the camera\u2019s being left in the room in the first place. While on vacation in an exotic spot, who wouldn\u2019t take their camera with them everywhere? Especially in the case of honeymooners on the trip of a lifetime, the natural urge is not to risk missing so much as a sunset. As often as this legend has been told, no one has yet to produce those mythical photos. They remain in the realm of  legend. However, in June 2004, at least some of the elements inherent to the tale did come to pass. That instance of partial ostension involved a group of teen girls who had been housed at the Broker Inn, a hotel in Boulder near the University of Colorado, the site of a cheerleading camp they\u2019d been attending. In the wake of the event, snapshots of a nude man were found among the developed photos taken from four of their cameras, which had been left at the hotel at various times during their stay. The man, who had been careful to keep his face hidden, was pictured moving about the girls\u2019 rooms, placing his genitals on their personal items, including their makeup bags and Gatorade bottles.  The story of the toothbrush bandits appears to have two messages: that crime will follow us anywhere (including into Paradise), and that blacks look to discomfit (not just rob) affluent white folks, making the robbery as much about anger and getting even as it ever was about merely wanting what someone else has. This tale turns on the assumption that the thieves bear ill will towards their victims, and the convenient explanation is the difference in race. Consider this: in the majority of tellings the thieves are said to be black, while in the remaining versions their color isn\u2019t specified. As hypnotically disgusting a story as this is, it\u2019s also a deeply racist one. Identifying those robbed as newlyweds gives the shock value an extra push, because there\u2019s the unspoken element of the couple, having only recently gained sexual experience, now being confronted with lewd and disgusting photos. The newlywed version further offends our sense of rightness in that these kids are on their honeymoon and thus should be the beneficiaries of the world\u2019s every indulgence. That they should become the targets of not only a robbery but also this level of hatred strikes us as sacrilege.

    "claim": "Giveaways on the Las Vegas Travel and Las Vegas Vacations Facebook pages are legitimate.",
    "content": " In early March 2021, readers alerted us to a Facebook scam that involved a Bora Bora vacation getaway. This led us to revisit Facebook pages like Las Vegas Travel that advertised a Las Vegas vacation giveaway. We previously made note of the suspicious Vegas page in July 2020. At the time, we archived a post from a different, though similar one: Las Vegas Vacations. At least one of the pages had a Russian page manager. On July 2, we noticed that the Las Vegas Travel page had shared a post from Las Vegas Vacations. It mentioned a purported grand opening celebration for a resort. \u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate our grand opening by doing something special for you. We will be rewarding someone who has shared then commented by August 26th with a 7-night stay for up to 5 people in a luxury suite. Don\u2019t worry about flights and transfers, it\u2019s all included.\u201d  Just like with the Bora Bora getaway, the Las Vegas pages were illegitimate. They should be avoided for the possibility of phishing, identity theft, and other potential consequences. We strongly suggest against submitting any personal information to links on these pages.       Since July, the Las Vegas Travel page attempted to expand its scheme to Instagram. Meanwhile, the Las Vegas Vacations page was still running the \u201cGrand Opening Celebration\u201d scam.  For almost a year and a half, Facebook failed to take action on the illegitimate pages. The Las Vegas Travel Facebook page was created in 2019. As of March 2021, it had around 250,000 followers. Las Vegas Vacations was created in July 2020. It was building toward 50,000 followers. The scam appeared to work in a similar way to the Bora Bora getaway. In fact, the same person or group of people appeared to manage both fake giveaways. We came to this conclusion after noticing similarities in dates and text on the pages. Further, the same .xyz domain website was listed. Here\u2019s how the scam worked. First, Facebook users were asked to like, share, and comment with the word: \u201cWIN.\u201d This February \u2013 We are giving away 10 nights at the The Venetian Las Vegas for 5 people. Includes Flights, Accommodation &amp; Transfers. You will have 2 years to use the holiday! To participate: 1. Like 2. Share 3. Comment: \u201cWIN\u201d Closes 28th February at 9pm. Next, a personal Facebook profile that appeared to be a page responded to each entrant. (A Facebook profile is for an individual person. A page is for companies, bands, personalities, etc.)       The response to each entrant read: \u201cYou win. Check my profile.\u201d The profile named \u201cLas Vegas-Nevanda\u201d had a name in its Facebook URL: facebook.com/titis.ariandini. It read: \u201cTitis Ariandini.\u201d  Entrants who clicked to view the \u201cLas Vegas-Nevanda\u201d profile were led to yet another post. It advised Facebook users to visit a link to register for a prize.  One Facebook user named Jason appeared to believe the scam giveaway was real. In the same comment, he also referred to effective measures to reduce the chance of more deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic as a \u201ccommunist shutdown.\u201d The link in the post led to a registration page that mirrored scammy websites we\u2019ve seen before.  The registration page resulted in affiliate marketing links for streaming movie websites. This was where the Bora Bora getaway pages ended as well. The point of the affiliate marketing was for the scammers to make commissions on signups on the streaming movie websites. Again, it was also possible that the scam involved phishing, identity theft, and other dangerous outcomes. We found a number of other pages that shared the Las Vegas scams. They appeared to be in the same network of Facebook pages. They included: Maldives 2021, Bora Bora Vacations, Cancun Tours, New York Christmas Vacations, Maldives Getaways, Santorini \u2013 Greece, Package Holidays 2021, Dominican Republic Vacations 2021, Bali Tourism, Visit Hawaii, Seychelles Holidays, Tourism Bali, Cabo Tourism, Cabo San Lucas 2021, and Bali Holidays. We noticed that some of these pages were scrubbed of their past scam posts. This allowed the page managers to plead innocence and continue running their post-and-delete operations. Further, this list of pages perhaps only scratched the surface of the entire scam empire. In sum, the giveaways that showed up on the Las Vegas Travel and Las Vegas Vacations Facebook pages were not legitimate. Facebook failed to take action on these scams despite their existence dating back to at least 2019. As a rule, it\u2019s always good to look for the \u201cverified\u201d badge on Facebook pages. ",
