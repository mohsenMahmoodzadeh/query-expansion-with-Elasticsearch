    "content": " Claim:   A character in the 1948 film Key Largo makes a prescient comment about Florida politicians.  Status:   False.  Example:   [Collected on the Internet, 2000]    This piece of dialogue is from Key Largo, made in 1948. Edward G. Robinson is explaining how things really work to Humphrey Bogart: \u201cLet me tell you about Florida politicians. I make them out of whole cloth, just like a tailor makes a suit. I get their name in the newspaper. I get them some publicity and get them on the ballot. Then after the election, we count the votes. And if they don\u2019t turn out right, we recount them. And recount them again. Until they do.\u201d          Origins:   Nice  --> try, but someone deliberately misreported a piece of dialogue from the 1948 crime drama Key Largo to make it seem like it was an eerie premonition of Florida politics some fifty years hence.   In the scene in question, Edward G. Robinson (as gangster Johnny Rocco) taunts John Rodney (as Deputy Clyde Sawyer) in front of a roomful of people by proclaiming that he is the real power behind the local government:   \u201cYou hick! I\u2019ll be back pulling strings to get guys elected mayor and governor before you ever get a 10-buck raise. Yeah, how many of those guys in office owe everything to me. I made them. Yeah, I made \u2019em, just like a \u2014 like a tailor makes a suit of clothes. I take a nobody, see? Teach him what to say. Get his name in the papers and pay for his campaign expenses. Dish out a lotta groceries and coal. Get my boys to bring the voters out. And then count the votes over and over again till they added up right and he was elected. Yeah \u2014 then what happens? Did he remember when the going got tough, when the heat was on? No, he didn\u2019t wanna. All he wanted was to save his own dirty neck . . . Yeah, \u2018Public Enemy,\u2019 he calls me. Me, who gave him his \u2018Public\u2019 all wrapped up with a fancy bow on it.\u201d   Yes, it\u2019s similar to the proffered quote, but it\u2019s not much of a parallel to the brouhaha over the Florida vote count in the 2000 presidential election when you consider that doesn\u2019t mention \u2018Florida\u2019 or \u2018recounts,\u2019 or even the word \u2018politicians.\u2019 Last updated:   17 August 2007         Sources:      Ebert, Roger.   \u201cMovie Answer Man.\u201d      Chicago Sun-Times.   17 December 2000.

    "content": "  Claim:   Several prominent politicians and political commentators were born nine months after the 1947 Roswell \u201cUFO\u201d incident.  FALSE        Examples:   [Collected via e-mail, 2006] Many will recall that on July 8, 1947, witnesses claim that an unidentified object with five aliens aboard crashed onto a sheep and cattle ranch just outside Roswell, New Mexico. This is a well-known incident that many say has long been covered up by the U.S. Air Force and the federal government. However, you may NOT know that in the month of March 1948, exactly nine months after that historic day, Albert Arnold Gore, Jr., Hillary Rodham, John F. Kerry, William Jefferson Clinton, Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, Charles E. Schumer, and Barbara Boxer were born. That piece of information has now cleared up a lot of things.     [Collected via e-mail, 2007] Could be coincidence\u2026  but then again\u2026 Many will recall that on July 8, 1947, witnesses claimed that an unidentified object with five aliens aboard crashed onto a sheep and cattle ranch just outside Roswell, New Mexico.  This is a well-known incident that many say has long been covered up by the U.S. Air Force and the rest of the U.S. government. However, what you may NOT have realized is that in the month of March 1948, exactly nine months after that historic day, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfield, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Condolezza Rice, and Dan Quayle were all born. See what happens when aliens breed with sheep? This piece of information may clear up a lot of things.     [Collected via e-mail, 2013] On July 8, 1947, a little more than 65 years ago, numerous witnesses claim that an Unidentified Flying Object, (UFO), with five aliens aboard, crashed onto a sheep and mule ranch just outside Roswell, New Mexico. This well-known incident has long been covered-up by the U.S. Air Force, as well as other Federal Agencies and organizations. In the month of April, 1948, nine months after the historic day, the following people were born: Barrack Obama, Sr. Albert A. Gore, Jr. Hillary Rodham William J. Clinton John F. Kerry Howard Dean Nancy Pelosi Dianne Feinstein Charles E. Schumer Barbara Boxer Joe Biden  This is the obvious consequence of aliens breeding with sheep and jack-asses.  I truly hope this bit of information clears up a lot of things. It certainly did for me.      Origins:   This amusing bit of political humor first hit our inbox in August 2006, positing a connection between July 1947 events in Roswell, New Mexico  (i.e., the alleged recovery of a crashed alien spacecraft and its occupants) and the birth nine months later of several prominent Democratic political figures.       At the risk of belaboring the obvious by deconstructing humor, we\u2019ll point out that the basic premise of the joke doesn\u2019t ring true.  First of all, the normal human gestation period is about 38 weeks, so children conceived on or shortly after the date of the Roswell incident (8 July 1947) would most likely have been born (assuming ordinary, full-term pregnancies) in April 1948, not March.  Second, only one of the political figures named was born even approximately nine months after the events as Roswell.   Five of the people listed were born well before March 1948:   Dianne Feinstein (U.S. Senator, California): 22 June 1933  Nancy Pelosi  (U.S. Representative, California): 26 March 1940  Barbara Boxer  (U.S. Senator, California):  11 November 1940  John Kerry (U.S. Senator, Massachusetts): 11 December 1943  Bill Clinton (former U.S. President): 19 August 1946  Two more of the persons identified were born considerably later than nine months after Roswell:   Howard Dean (former Governor of Vermont):  17 November 1948  Charles E. Schumer (U.S. Senator, New York): 23 November 1950  Hillary Rodham Clinton (U.S. Senator, New York) was born on 26 October 1947, a mere three months after the Roswell incident.       Only Al Gore, Jr. (former U.S. Vice-President), who was born on 31 March 1948, came into the world at a time that reasonably fits into the framework of this humorous premise.  Quite possibly this item started out as a joke specifically about him, and others later expanded it into a joke about Democrats in general. In April 2007, the jape was reworked to aim it at prominent Republicans and conservative pundits.  Four of the figures named on that list were born well before March 1948:   Donald Rumsfield (former Secretary of Defense): 9 July 1932  Dick Cheney (U.S. Vice-President): 30 January 1941  George W. Bush (U.S. President): 6 July 1946  Dan Quayle (former U.S. Vice-President): 4 February 1947  Three others were born considerably later than nine months after Roswell:   Bill O\u2019Reilly (political commentator): 10 September 1949  Rush Limbaugh (political commentator): 12 January 1951  Condoleezza Rice (Secretary of State): 14 November 1954  A 2013 updating added the names of a few more Democrats, none of whose birthdates fit the posited timeline:   Barack Obama, Sr. (father of President Barack Obama): 18 June 1936  Joe Biden (U.S. Vice-President): 20 November 1942  Last updated:   8 July 2013   Sources:    &nbsp; &nbsp;  Vitullo-Martin, Julia. &nbsp; The Executive's Book of Quotations.   &nbsp; &nbsp; New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. &nbsp; 0-19-507836-5 &nbsp; (p. 230).   --> ",

    "title": "Did These Politicians Build Walls Around Their Homes?",

    "claim": "Photographs show walls around the homes of President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein and Maxine Waters.",
    "content": " As the year 2018 drew to a close, many pundits maintained that it was hypocritical for (Democratic) politicians to oppose funding the construction of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico while simultaneously themselves living in homes surrounded by walls.   (For the purposes of this article, we will eschew dwelling on the differences between walls and fences, and on the multiple uses of walls and fences for purposes other than keeping out intruders.)  In February 2018, for example, photographs supposedly showing walls around the homes of U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s (D-Mass.) were circulated, along with disparaging messages labeling the two politicians as hypocrites. (Neither of the photographs used in those rumors actually featured the homes of Pelosi or Kennedy.) Then in December 2018, President Donald Trump picked up the line of attack when he (falsely) claimed that former president Barack Obama\u2019s Washington, D.C., residence had a \u201cten-foot wall\u201d around the property:  President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2018        This same argument has been used to disparage other politicians.  In January 2019, a set of images supposedly showing walls around the homes of the Obamas, Nancy Pelosi, the Clintons, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was also circulated on social media   This meme was inaccurate in several ways, including the use of misleading photographs. Barack Obama:  The photograph labeled \u201cObama\u201d truly shows a portion of Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s current residence in Washington, D.C. However, the claim that the home is surrounded by a 10-foot wall is inaccurate.        As a former president of the United States, Barack and Michelle Obama (as well as all other former presidents and their spouses) are afforded the lifelong protection of the Secret Service under the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012.  Certain security features were therefore added to the Obamas\u2019 home in order to facilitate the Secret Service\u2019s ability to perform their protection activities.  For instance, a guard booth was constructed near the front door of the home, brick pillars and fencing were added to the retaining wall in the front of the house, and a chain-link fence was added to the back.  However, the Obamas\u2019 home is not surrounded by a 10-foot wall.  The house is still clearly visible from the streets, and photographs document that the stairway leading from the main entrance of the home down to the street is not impeded by a wall, fence, or security gate, as the Washington Post noted:  A neighbor, a longtime resident of the area who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve their privacy, said Trump \u201chas a very active imagination.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a fence that goes along the front of the [Obamas\u2019] house, but it\u2019s the same as the other neighbors have,\u201d the neighbor said. \u201cIt\u2019s tastefully done.\u201d Another neighbor said the Obamas\u2019 home is \u201c100 percent visible from the street.\u201d \u201cThere is no 10-foot wall in the front, back or sides of the house \u2014 and no wall is going up,\u201d the person said.  Hillary Clinton  Former president Bill Clinton and his spouse, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, maintain a residence in Chappaqua, New York, which they purchased in November 1999 while Bill Clinton was still President of the United States.  Shortly afterwards, an eight-foot tall fence was installed around the border of the property, along with a gate and security office:      Again, how much of that construction might have been undertaken in order the facilitate the activities of the Secret Service protective detail is difficult to determine.  The New York Daily News reported in December 1999 that four Secret Service agents had participated in presenting a plan to the local zoning board for a variance to construct an 8-foot-tall fence around the Clinton property (since the zoning laws in the area at the time prohibited fences higher than 6 feet) and to install a guard booth near the entrance. Both proposals were approved:  [T]he zoning board of appeals for the town of New Castle voted unanimously to approve variances for an 8-foot-tall white-stained cedar fence. The Clintons sent four Secret Service agents to present their application to the board, because town zoning rules prohibit fences higher than 6 feet. The fence, which will come right down to the edge of the street, will block any views of the house and eliminate a favorite path for neighborhood kids who cut through the house\u2019s backyard \u2026 The zoning board also gave approval for a 4-by-6-foot guardhouse \u2014 with a turret \u2014 just inside the gate. While residents criticized the Clintons\u2019 plans for the house, no one showed up at the meeting to protest, said board chairman Gabriel Rosenfeld.       Nancy Pelosi  When a similar rumor was circulated about Rep. Nancy Pelosi in February 2018, the purveyors of that misinformation used a photograph of Pelosi\u2019s San Francisco neighborhood, but not one of her actual house. In this case it appears the image actually used a photograph of a property owned by Pelosi (although we aren\u2019t entirely sure). Regardless, it\u2019s unlikely that the pictured \u201cwall\u201d provides any significant security, as it is only a foot or two high. Furthermore, the largely decorative wall only covers the entrance and does not surround the entire property. Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, own an estate and vineyard along the banks of the Napa River on Zinfandel Lane in Northern California. The image purportedly showing Pelosi\u2019s estate in this meme was found by the sleuths at the American Mirror (a hyperpartisan website that frequently publishes questionable content) using Google Maps. Although we\u2019ve yet to come across a listed address for this property, we examined aerial images of this street and agree that the image likely shows the entrance of the Pelosi\u2019s estate, as it is the only property bordering the Napa River and Zinfandel Lane that appears to be worthy of the reported $5-$20 million value. However, the pictured wall is simply a stone border wall that doesn\u2019t encircle the entire property and is no more than a few feet high:  Photographs of another home owned by Pelosi in San Francisco show that that property is not surrounded by walls, either:        Dianne Feinstein  The image labeled \u201cFeinstein\u201d was originally published by The Daily Caller in a 2013 article about a small fire near the senator\u2019s residence in D.C. that required the response of emergency crews. Although the address listed in that report matched the address in a 2001 Washington Life article about the Feinstein\u2019s home, we have not been able to verify if the senator still maintains a residence at this address. The view of this property from OpenStreetMap appears to show the it is surrounded by a fence about five feet high:  Maxine Waters  The image labeled \u201cWaters\u201d in this graphic was originally circulated online with a different criticism of the politician. When the conspiracy-driven True Pundit website published this photograph in April 2017, they were describing Waters as a hypocrite for living in a mansion while fighting for the poor.  The photograph they published of the front of this Hancock Park, California, residence clearly showed it was not surrounded by a wall, however:  Although the residence is flanked by a brick wall along one side, other images of the residence \u2014 including a video shot by Omar Navarro as he announced his candidacy for Congress in front of Maxine Waters house \u2014 show the rest of the property to be completely open:  ",

    "content": " In September 2018, a number of social media accounts started sharing a photograph purported to show 26 \u2018corrupt\u2019 Chinese politicians moments before their execution:  This photograph was not recent in 2018, it did not feature corrupt politicians, and it was not taken during the course of a public execution. This photograph was snapped in Wenzhou, China, in April 2004 and shows Chinese police officers escorting a group of \u201chardcore convicts\u201d at a \u201csentencing rally.\u201d This picture is available via Getty Images where it is accompanied by the following caption: WENZHOU, CHINA: Chinese police show of a group of hardcore convicts at a sentencing rally in the east Chinese city of Wenzhou, 07 April 2004, where 11 prisoners were later excuted for various crimes. Amnesty International has called for a moratorium on the death penalty in China, saying the country\u2019s dysfunctional criminal justice system meant many innocent people were being executed, after a senior Chinese legislator suggested China executes at least 10,000 people a year, about five times more than the rest of the world combined. AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)       We attempted to find more information about the crimes committed by the pictured individuals but were unable to uncover news about this specific incident. We suspect that the majority of people seen in this photograph were convicted of drug trafficking offenses, as the China Daily reported in June 2004, two months after this photograph was taken, that dozens of drug dealers had recently been executed in the country, with some of them having been sentenced in Wenzhou: Dozens of drug dealers were sentenced to death in a series of drug-related criminal cases across China as the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking draws near. In southwestern Yunnan province, Tan Minglin and three other people convicted of smuggling or selling five tons of drugs, including heroin and ephedrine, were executed after having all their belongings confiscated. Another Chen Xue\u2019an and three other suspects accused of illegally purchasing 60 kg of drugs by raising over four million yuan (US$481,000) were sentenced to death in Wenzhou city of east China\u2019s Zhejiang province. A contemporaneous report from Amnesty International stated that China \u201ceasily operates the most stringent capital punishment regime\u201d and that the the country had executed an estimated 3,400 people in 2004: The report says China easily operates the most stringent capital punishment regime, with an estimated 3,400 executions last year. In second place, Iran executed at least 159, Vietnam at least 64, and 59 prisoners were put to death in the US. The number of executions worldwide last year was the highest since 1996, when 4,272 were carried out. No official figures are available for China\u2019s execution rate, and Amnesty has changed the method it uses to calculate the number of executions there. According to Amnesty\u2019s report for 2003 China carried out at least 726 executions. The much higher figure of 3,400 executed last year is an estimate based on internet reports of trials, although it is still described as the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. China was still at the top of Amnesty International\u2019s annual report on capital punishment in 2018. ",

Washington D.C. The Neon Nettle article\u2019s central claim is false, and was arrived at using flawed logic and downright misrepresentation of the study\u2019s actual findings. In fact, the article itself contains disclaimers about the significance of Washington, D.C.\u2019s top spot in the rankings, suggesting that the headline is no more than inaccurate and sensationalist clickbait: [The author] wrote that people should take the capitol\u2019s top spot with a little bit of skepticism.

Murphy used existing 2013 research which employed online personality tests to measure the prevalence of the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits: Extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. (Interestingly, one of the online tests used in the 2013 research was myPersonality, a Facebook app which in 2018 was revealed to have been involved in the leaking of three million users\u2019 personal data.) Using these extrapolated estimates, Murphy came up with a ranking of 48 states and D.C. for the prevalence of traits consistent with psychopathy. Washington, D.C. had the highest prevalence, followed by Connecticut, California, New Jersey, Wyoming and New York. The states with the lowest prevalence of psychopathy, according to Murphy, were West Virginia, Vermont, Tennessee, North Carolina, and New Mexico. You can see the full list below:  Murphy did not measure or estimate the prevalence of psychopathy among politicians, so Neon Nettle\u2019s claim that the study had \u201crevealed\u201d that 99.9 percent of politicians are psychopaths is false on its face. Furthermore, Murphy\u2019s research involved proxy measures of the prevalence of psychopathy. That is, he extrapolated estimates of the prevalence of certain personality traits consistent with psychopathy, rather than measuring rates of clinical diagnosis. This further undermines Neon Nettle\u2019s claim that the study had found 99.9 percent of politicians are \u201cactual psychopaths.\u201d The paper did mention the fact that existing research has more strongly associated certain occupations with psychopathy than others. Research conducted by the University of Oxford psychologist Kevin Dutton found ten professions with an unusually high proportion of psychopaths: chief executive officers, lawyers, television and radio news anchors and analysts, salespersons, surgeons, journalists, police officers, clergy, chefs, civil servants. While \u201cpolitician\u201d is not on that list, elected politicians often emerge from some of the professions listed, such as lawyer, CEO, and civil servant. Dutton has observed elsewhere: Traits that are common among psychopathic serial killers -\u2014 a grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse and the manipulation of others \u2014 are also shared by politicians and world leaders. Individuals, in other words, running not from the police but for office. And in the paper cited by Neon Nettle, Murphy wrote: \u201cThe presence of psychopaths in [the] District of Columbia is consistent with the conjecture found in Murphy (2016) that psychopaths are likely to be effective in the political sphere.\u201d Another 2012 study codified certain subjective assessments of job performance, such as behavior and responses to crisis situations, among 42 United States presidents, then scored each of them according to several tests for personality traits consistent with psychopathy. It found that, on average, the presidents scored higher than the general population according to one of those metrics, which measured fearlessness and dominance. When it came to other personality traits consistent with psychopathy, there was no difference between the presidents and the general public. There is a basis in the existing research for concluding that politicians are more likely than the general population to possess and display personality traits consistent with psychopathy, such as ruthlessness, fearlessness, persuasiveness, boldness, and so on. However, the prevalence of psychopathic traits among politicians or those involved in politics is still likely to be very low. According to one widely-cited study, an estimated 1.2 percent of the general population possess personality traits consistent with psychopathy. Among business leaders, that prevalence appears to be higher. One study found 3.9 percent of managers displayed psychopathic traits, while another placed that figure at 5.76 percent, and estimated that as many as 10.43 percent of \u201cwhite-collar\u201d managers were \u201cdysfunctional,\u201d meaning \u201cpsychopathic characteristics were clearly present although not to a degree that would allow a reliable medical diagnosis to be made.\u201d It\u2019s possible that the prevalence of personality traits consistent with psychopathy might be as high in the world of politics, but despite the claims made by this article, any reliable figures are lacking.

    "claim": "A list collects statements about rape made by Republican politicians.",
    "content": " A \u201cRepublicans on Rape\u201d graphic widely circulated online since 2014 collects various comments about that crime supposedly made by GOP politicians in recent years:  The remarks collected in that graphic were indeed all uttered by the persons to whom they have been attributed; below we offer four of the statements on video (also on YouTube), as well as the context in which they were made, and any clarifying remarks subsequently offered by their speakers.             \u201cRape is kinda like the weather. If it\u2019s inevitable, relax and enjoy it.\u201d On 24 March 1990, Texas oilman Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee in the Lone Star State\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial election, was preparing for a cattle roundup at his West Texas ranch while undesirable weather conditions threatened to spoil the event. As he sat around a campfire with ranch hands, campaign workers, and reporters, Williams likened that day\u2019s cold, foggy weather to rape, saying, \u201cIf it\u2019s inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.\u201d Later that day Williams asserted that his comment had been a joke, and a few days later his campaign offered an apologetic statement about it: Mr. Williams said it was merely a joke and apologized \u201cif anyone\u2019s offended.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not a Republican women\u2019s club that we were having this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a working cow camp, a tough world where you can get kicked in the testicles if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d Asked if some people might be offended, Mr. Williams said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you a serious answer. It wasn\u2019t a serious deal. It wasn\u2019t a serious statement.\u201d But his campaign issued a statement in which Mr. Williams said: \u201cI feel just terrible about this. I had no intention in my heart to hurt anyone, especially those women who have been traumatized by rape. \u201cLooking back, I realize it was insensitive and had no place at the campfire or in any setting.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that thing down.\u201d On 19 August 2012, U.S. Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, a Republican who was challenging incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill for her seat in the U.S. Senate, was interviewed by St. Louis television station KTVI. During that interview, Akin was asked whether he believed abortion was justified in cases of rape, and he responded by asserting that \u201clegitimate rapes\u201d rarely resulted in pregnancy: \u201cIt seems to be, first of all, from what I understand from doctors, it\u2019s really rare. If it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down.\u201d After his words touched off widespread outrage, Akin then issued a statement maintaining that his remarks were \u201coff-the-cuff\u201d and that he \u201cmisspoke in this interview\u201d: As a member of Congress, I believe that working to protect the most vulnerable in our society is one of my most important responsibilities, and that includes protecting both the unborn and victims of sexual assault. In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it\u2019s clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year. Those who perpetrate these crimes are the lowest of the low in our society and their victims will have no stronger advocate in the Senate to help ensure they have the justice they deserve. I recognize that abortion, and particularly in the case of rape, is a very emotionally charged issue. But I believe deeply in the protection of all life and I do not believe that harming another innocent victim is the right course of action. I also recognize that there are those who, like my opponent, support abortion and I understand I may not have their support in this election.       Two years later, while appearing in another television interview with MSNBC to promote his new book Firing Back, Akin asserted that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d was a law enforcement term and that his original remark had been \u201cintentionally misunderstood\u201d: \u201cLegitimate rape is a law enforcement term, it\u2019s an abbreviation for \u2018legitimate case of rape,\u2019\u201d he told Chuck Todd. \u201cA woman calls a police station, the police investigate, she says \u2018I\u2019ve been raped,\u2019 they investigate that. So before any of the facts are in, they call it a legitimate case of rape,\u201d explained Aiken. Akin believes that everyone took what he said out of context. \u201cThis was intentionally misunderstood and twisted for political purposes. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to say \u2018a conservative is saying that rape is legitimate,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t even add up.\u201d Time magazine noted that they were unable to find a law enforcement official familiar with the term \u201clegitimate rape\u201d: But is \u201clegitimate rape\u201d really a law enforcement term? We asked some experts. \u201cI\u2019ve taught police officers, and worked with police officers on every continent in the world, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never heard in my 50 years in law enforcement,\u201d says Dr. James A. Williams, former Chief of Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces for the U.S Department of Justice, who also worked in municipal law enforcement in New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that. Never.\u201d Richard Lichten, a veteran of the LA County Sheriff\u2019s Department and expert on sexual assault investigations agrees: \u201cI have 30 years of experience, I\u2019m qualified to testify in federal court on the way to investigate sexual assault crimes, and I\u2019ve never heard of that,\u201d said Lichten. \u201cIn all my life I\u2019ve never heard of that.\u201d \u201cRape victims should make the best of a bad situation.\u201d On 20 January 2012, Rick Santorum, a former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania who was then campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, appeared on CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan Tonight program and was asked by that show\u2019s host about his stance on abortion and whether he believed abortion was wrong even in cases of incest and rape. Santorum responded by saying that although a pregnancy resulting from a rape might be \u201chorrible,\u201d it was nonetheless a \u201cgift of human life\u201d and that \u201cwe have to make the best out of a bad situation\u201d: MORGAN: On abortion, you did harden your position on that as you got older. Why was that? SANTORUM: Life. You know, when I decided to run for public life, I was informed very quickly people wanted to know what my position on that was. So I went through the process of trying to better understand the facts. It became very clear to me that life begins at conception and persons are covered by the Constitution and since life \u2014 people, a human life is the same as a person, to me it was a pretty simple deduction to make. That\u2019s what the Constitution clearly intended to protect. MORGAN: But do you really \u2014 do you really \u2014 let me ask you this. Do you really believe, in every case, it should be totally wrong, in the sense that \u2014 I know that you believe, even in cases of rape and incest \u2014 and you\u2019ve got two daughters. You know, if you have a daughter that came to you who had been raped. SANTORUM: Yes. MORGAN: And was pregnant and was begging you to let her have an abortion, would you really be able to look her in the eye and say, no, as her father? SANTORUM: I would do what every father must do, is to try to counsel your daughter to do the right thing. MORGAN: And they are looking at their daughter, saying, how can I deal with this, because if I make her have this baby, isn\u2019t it going to just ruin her life? SANTORUM: Well, you can make the argument that if she doesn\u2019t have this baby, if she kills her child, that that, too, could ruin her life. And this is not an easy choice. I understand that. As horrible as the way that that son or daughter and son was created, it still is her child. And whether she has that child or doesn\u2019t, it will always be her child. And she will always know that. And so to embrace her and to love her and to support her and get her through this very difficult time, I\u2019ve always, you know, I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created \u2014 in the sense of rape \u2014 but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you. As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can\u2019t think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation. \u201cEven when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\u201d       On 23 October 2012, Richard Mourdock, the Republican candidate for one of Indiana\u2019s U.S. Senate seats, was engaged in a debate with his Democratic and Libertarian rivals when he expressed his view that \u201clife begins at conception\u201d and that he would only allow abortions in circumstances in which the mother\u2019s life was in danger: I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is that gift from God. And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen. After the debate, Mourdock explained that when he said \u201cit is something that God intended to happen,\u201d he was referring to the creation of life and not the act of rape itself: Mourdock, seeking to clarify his comments in a press conference following the debate, said he had intended to say that \u201cGod creates life,\u201d and that any interpretation of his comments to mean God \u201cpre-ordained rape\u201d were \u201csick\u201d and \u201ctwisted.\u201d \u201cWhat I said was, in answering the question form my position of faith, I said I believe that God creates life. I believe that as wholly and as fully as I can believe it. That God creates life,\u201d Mourdock said. \u201cAre you trying to suggest that somehow I think that God pre-ordained rape? No, I don\u2019t think that. That\u2019s sick. Twisted. That\u2019s not even close to what I said. What I said is that God creates life.\u201d \u201cIn the emergency room they have what\u2019s called rape kits, where a woman can get cleaned out.\u201d On 23 June 2013, Jodie Laubenberg, a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, was debating a measure she had introduced to the House that included a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. When Rep. Senfronia Thompson proposed an exemption for victims of rape and incest, Laubenberg argued against that exemption, saying that when a victim seeks medical care after a rape, \u201cthey have what\u2019s called rape kits, that the woman can get cleaned out, basically like\u201d [a procedure known as D and C that is often performed after a miscarriage]. She also noted that emergency contraception is available. A few days later, after she was mocked over her remark, Laubenberg said she was \u201cconfused by Democrats\u2019 questions and misspoke\u201d and meant to say that rape victims could \u201cobtain emergency contraception and other treatment\u201d at medical facilities: Rape kits are used to collect evidence in hopes of prosecuting the perpetrator. They play no role in preventing pregnancy or serving as an abortion. Laubenberg was widely mocked on social media, and opponents of the bill called her comments evidence of the misguided science behind Laubenberg\u2019s proposal. Laubenberg told North Texas talk radio host Mark Davis that she was momentarily confused by Democrats\u2019 questions and misspoke. \u201cWhat I was trying to say is, when a woman goes to the hospital, that they have the procedures there\u201d to help her obtain emergency contraception and other treatment, she said. \u201cNo, rape kits do not cause an abortion.\u201d As for the reaction, Laubenberg added: \u201cIf that\u2019s the worst that you can complain about me, go ahead.\u201d       \u201cIf a woman has (the right to an abortion), why shouldn\u2019t a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman? At least the rapist\u2019s pursuit of sexual freedom doesn\u2019t (in most cases) result in anyone\u2019s death.\u201d In February 2014, the Maine Democratic Party called for the resignation of Lawrence Lockman, a Republican member of the Maine House of Representatives, when a liberal activist made a blog post detailing negative public statements about gays, abortion and rape that Lockman had made years earlier: The post by Maine People\u2019s Alliance activist Mike Tipping mined press clippings to unearth several offensive comments. In one, Lockman implied that HIV and AIDS could be spread by bed sheets and mosquitoes. In another, he said that the progressive movement assisted the AIDS epidemic by assuring \u201cthe public that the practice of sodomy is a legitimate alternative lifestyle, rather than a perverted and depraved crime against humanity.\u201d In a 1995 letter in the Sun Journal in Lewiston, a reader quoted a press statement by Lockman, then part of the Pro Life Education Association, saying, \u201cIf a woman has (the right to an abortion), why shouldn\u2019t a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman? At least the rapist\u2019s pursuit of sexual freedom doesn\u2019t (in most cases) result in anyone\u2019s death.\u201d Lockman responded to the controversy by issuing a statement affirming that he regretted his previous remarks: Most of the comments were made during the 1980s and 1990s, but Maine Democratic Party chairman Ben Grant issued a statement calling for Lockman\u2019s resignation. Grant said the comments were \u201chateful, vicious and offensive\u201d and he called Lockman a \u201cdisturbed individual who holds some of the most abhorrent beliefs ever heard from a public official in Maine.\u201d Lockman released a written statement. \u201cI have always been passionate about my beliefs, and years ago I said things that I regret. I hold no animosity toward anyone by virtue of their gender or sexual orientation, and today I am focused on ensuring freedom and economic prosperity for all Mainers,\u201d he said. ",

(That was before he suddenly became the focus of Trump\u2019s ire in December 2018, when he resigned from his post shortly after the president announced his intention to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.) One quotation attributed to Mattis burnished the retired Marine Corps general\u2019s reputation in right-leaning, social media circles as a grizzled, no-nonsense conservative icon.  What pisses me off is my men defend freedom all over the world with a gun. Yet when they come home some pantyhose-wearing politician wants to make them defenseless against thousands of armed jihadi terrorists.

We could find no corroborating evidence of Mattis ever having said or written those words, despite checking online news archives dating back several decades.  \u201cMad World News\u201d is a Facebook page and website with a history of posting provocative and occasionally inflammatory memes. It has a track record of publishing misleading and inaccurate stories, particularly about Muslims, some of which we have examined previously. Although we can\u2019t definitively say one way or another, the absence of any independent corroboration for the purported quotation, or even a cited source or date in the meme, along with the previous record of \u201cMad World News,\u201d strongly suggest that the quotation is fabricated.

    "content": " Memes are frequently circulated online containing a quip ostensibly uttered by Robin Williams to the effect that \u201cpoliticians should wear sponsor jackets like NASCAR drivers\u201d: We have not been able to find any record of Williams using this exact phrasing. However, Williams, who died in 2014, did make a similar joke as the character Tom Dobbs in the 2006 movie \u201cMan of the Year.\u201d In that film, Dobbs says: \u201cIf you\u2019re representing special interest groups, maybe we should be like NASCAR with the little patches on the back: \u2018Enron: We take your money and run!'\u201d This line can be heard around the 50 second mark of the \u201cMan of the Year\u201d trailer:      This 2006 movie, however, was not the first time someone suggested that politicians should have to display their corporate sponsorships.        In 2004, for instance, columnist Paul Halvey wrote in the Illinois paper \u201cThe Life\u201d that \u201cwhen a company springs for a political campaign contributions, it should be able to put its logo on the politician.\u201d In 1999, columnist Jim Hightower made a similar suggestion, writing: We\u2019d like to mandate full and forceful disclosure\u2014make every politician or candidate own up to where every dollar of their money\u2019s coming from. Maybe we could even make \u2019em wear their sponsors\u2019 logos like NASCAR drivers do, as in the illustrations in this issue. But this idea dates back at least a little further. The earliest example that we could find comes from a column published in March 1995 in the Harford Courant entitled \u201cPoliticians Should Wear Sponsor Logos\u201d by journalist Don Noel:  08 Mar 1995, Wed Hartford Courant (Hartford, Connecticut) Newspapers.com We\u2019re not sure who came up with the exact phrasing of the viral version of the joke. The idea that politicians should wear the logos of their corporate sponsors on their clothes, similar to NASCAR drivers, has been circulating since the 1990s. While it doesn\u2019t seem as if this quote originated with Williams, the concept served as a basis for a line his character said in the 2006 film \u201cMan of the Year.\u201d ",
