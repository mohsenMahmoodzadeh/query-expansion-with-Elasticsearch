    "title": "Did a 1922 Article Advise Not to Worry About Hitler\u2019s Anti-Semitism?",

    "claim": "A 1922 New York Times article reported that Adolf Hitler \u201cwas merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers\u201d.",
    "content": " On 10 February 2015, the New York Times re-released the first article they ever published about Adolf Hitler, who was then the chairman of the Nazi party. The story, dated 21 November 1922 and republished in the Times\u2018 \u201cFirst Glimpses\u201d section, opened with this introduction: On Nov. 21, 1922, The New York Times gave its readers their first glimpse of Hitler, in a profile that got a lot of things right \u2014 its description of his ability to work a crowd into a fever pitch, ready then and there to stage a coup, presaged his unsuccessful beer hall putsch less than a year later. But the article also got one crucial point very wrong \u2014 despite what \u201cseveral reliable, well-informed sources\u201d told The Times in the third paragraph from the bottom, his anti-Semitism was every bit as genuine and violent as it sounded. This re-release was widely covered by other news outlets immediately after it was posted in 2015, with many of them suggesting or implying its description bore similarities to the political movement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. An excerpt from that 1922 article reads as follows: But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes. A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\u201d This story was published early in both Hitler\u2019s career and in the existence of the Nazi party itself, whose followers were then called \u2018Hakenkreuzler,\u2019 or \u2018swastika wavers.\u2019 In November 1922, when this article was first published, Hitler had been Nazi party chairman for just over a year, and it had been only three years since he had delivered his first public political speech. Hitler\u2019s failed attempt to overthrow the local government in Bavaria, known as the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch,\u201d was one year away. The Times reached out to Hitler for comment in 1922, which he declined, as described in the story: \u201cHerr Hitler regrets he is unable to meet you as he is leaving town on important business for several days,\u201d was the answer received by The New York Times correspondent. His important business was going to Regensburg with three special trainloads of Munich admirers for the purpose of holding a series of reactionary inflammatory meetings and incidentally to beat up protesting Socialists and Communists with blackjacks if any dare protest, which is becoming increasingly rarer.

    "claim": "The New York Times published Darren Wilson's current residence address, then redacted it.",
    "content": " On 24 November 2014, the day St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced that a grand jury declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in connection with the death of Michael Brown, the New York Times published an article titled \u201cA Quiet Wedding for Darren Wilson.\u201d The article reported upon Wilson\u2019s recent wedding to fellow officer Barbara Spradling as well as the then-imminent indictment decision. Wilson, 28, and Spradling, 37, married on 24 October 2014 in St. Louis County. The Times coverage included the following text:  Both Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling were previously married, public records indicate. His divorce was finalized on Nov. 10, 2013. Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling own a home together on Manda Lane in Crestwood, Mo., a St. Louis suburb about a half-hour drive from Ferguson.  Although Wilson and Spradling owned a home in Crestwood, it was not their current residence at the time the article was published, as the paper noted that they had vacated the premises shortly after the 9 August 2014 shooting:  They have scarcely been seen there since Mr. Brown was killed on Aug. 9. Neighbors said that within a few days of the shooting, Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling abruptly left their home.  Along with the content of the article, the paper included a picture of Wilson and Spradling\u2019s marriage license. While the image included an address, that address was not the Crestwood house formerly occupied by the couple; it was the address of a law firm in nearby Clayton, Missouri. When the article drew scrutiny, the Times removed the image of Wilson and Spradling\u2019s marriage license and appended the following editor\u2019s note: \u201cAn earlier version of this post included a photograph that contained information that should not have been made public. The image has been removed.\u201d That redaction led many readers to mistakenly believe that the Times had published Wilson\u2019s current residence address and then withdrawn that information due to public protest, but the address published by the paper in the since-edited article was for a law firm and not for the domicile in which Wilson was currently living. The Times did mention that Wilson and his wife own a house in Crestwood and referenced the street name, but they did not publish the full address. Moreover, that information was neither current nor revelatory in nature since (as noted in the same article) the Wilsons had vacated the house months earlier, and that same information had already been widely disseminated back in August 2014 in coverage of the Mike Brown case published in major newspapers such as the  Washington Post and the Boston Globe.

    "claim": "Donald Trump gave an unprecedented order for all politically appointed ambassadors to resign immediately.",
    "content": " On 5 January 2016, the New York Times published an article concerning a State Department cable sent to diplomats on 23 December 2016 by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, informing them that they were to leave their posts prior to Inauguration Day \u201cwithout exception\u201d: President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods. The mandate \u2014 issued \u201cwithout exceptions,\u201d according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23, diplomats who saw it said \u2014 threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain. In the past, administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow a handful of ambassadors, particularly those with school-age children, to remain in place for weeks or months. Mr. Trump, by contrast, has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama\u2019s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor\u2019s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements. \u201cPolitical\u201d ambassadors, many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president, almost always leave at the end of his term; ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts. A State Department official confirmed to Politico  that the Trump transition team would not be making any exceptions for ambassadors requesting extensions to remain at their posts. Aggregated versions of the New York Timess report, social media summaries, and a general misunderstanding of what the New York Times  had&amp; actually reported led many readers to believe that President-elect Trump had broken precedent when he ordered political ambassadors appointed by President Obama to leave their posts by his inauguration date. However, the \u201cprecedent\u201d at the center of the Times article had to do with whether the incoming president would allow exceptions for outgoing ambassadors who wished to remain in their positions for a period of time past Inauguration Day. While previous administrations have allowed exceptions on a case-by-case basis, the incoming Trump administration broke with that tradition by saying that ambassadors had to leave their posts \u201cwithout exception.\u201d       Asgeir Sigfusson, a spokesperson for the American Foreign Service Association, was even hesitant to say that Trump\u2019s no-extensions policy was unprecedented. Instead, Sigfusson noted that AFSA members had called it \u201cunusual,\u201d while Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, president of the American Foreign Service Association noted that Trump\u2019s policy was atypical: \u201cWe go through this process every time there is a change of administration. Political appointees are generally expected to prepare for departure around the time a new President is inaugurated, particularly if there is a change of party. We understand the new administration is adhering strictly to a no-extensions policy, which is not always the case. It\u2019s important to point out that embassies have a Deputy Chief of Mission, a career diplomat who serves as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires until a new Ambassador is confirmed. That person is always a career Foreign Service officer, typically with decades of experience, and is selected with the expectation that he or she is fully up to the task of running an Embassy.\u201d John Kirby, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, also said that the policy was unusual and that previous administrations had granted a \u201chandful\u201d of exceptions, but he confirmed that political appointees should have no expectation of staying at their posts beyond the term of the president who appointed them: So look, I think I can break this down pretty easily, as I\u2019ve seen the press coverage on this as well. All political appointees for the Obama Administration were directed to submit their letters of resignation, and the due date was December 7th, and the resignations are to take effect at noon on January 20th. All political appointees were directed to do that. That is common, typical practice. And when you\u2019re a political appointee for this or any other administration, you have no expectation of staying beyond the inauguration of a new administration. That\u2019s the way it works. For career Foreign Service officers, there this year has been no such directive, no such expectation for them to have to submit resignations at the end of the term. Now, I can\u2019t speak for the incoming team, but all political appointees \u2014 and frankly, even careers as ambassadors or military admirals and generals \u2014 you serve at the pleasure of the president. So the incoming team can make decisions on their own about who they want in what chair and for how long. But all political appointees under this Administration, including a knucklehead like me, you have to submit your resignation and be prepared to have January 20th be your last day in office. You serve at the pleasure of the president, and when your president \u2014 his terms runs out, you have every expectation that your term will run out. That\u2019s the way it works. [\u2026] You\u2019d have to talk to the Trump transition team about why they decided to not be willing to broker exceptions or waivers, requests to extend. I can\u2019t speak to that. That\u2019s really for them. But \u2014 hang on. But you\u2019re right that in the past there have been a handful, a small number, of extension requests granted, but that is totally in the prerogative of the incoming team. And for \u2014 it\u2019s for them to determine whether they\u2019d be willing to accept or deny individual requests to extend. It\u2019s really for them to speak to. Peter Cianchette, for instance, was made an ambassador to Costa Rica by President George W. Bush in June 2008, and President Obama allowed Cianchette to remain in his position until July 2009. Similarly, Diane E. Watson, who was appointed an ambassador of Micronesia by former President Bill Clinton, remained at her post long after George W. Bush assumed office. We found similar examples of presidents allowing ambassadors appointed by their predecessors to remain at their posts past Inauguration Day for every presidential transition dating back to 1977, when Jimmy Carter succeeded Gerald Ford. When President Obama requested ambassador resignations before the start of his administration in 2009, a State Department official told Agence France-Presse that requests for extensions by political ambassadors would be looked at on a case-by-case basis: \u201cThe message was something that is normally sent out (after every election every four years) by the State Department at the request of the White House,\u201d the State Department official said. \u201cIt\u2019s a normal procedure for ambassadors, career and non-career, to submit their resignations. And what happens is that all of them do,\u201d according to the official who added the message was sent out Tuesday. \u201cAnd in many cases, career ambassadors will be notified that they can stay in place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have from time to time political (appointee) ambassadors who come in with requests to maybe extend for a couple of months for family reasons or whatever, and those are looked at on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said.

    "claim": "Stanford University rejected all applicants for the Class of 2020, cementing their status as an upper-crust institution.",
    "content": " On 30 March 2016, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni published an op-ed titled \u201cCollege Admissions Shocker!\u201d that began as follows: PALO ALTO, California \u2014 Cementing its standing as the most selective institution of higher education in the country, Stanford University announced this week that it had once again received a record-setting number of applications and that its acceptance rate \u2014 which had dropped to a previously uncharted low of 5 percent last year \u2014 plummeted all the way to its inevitable conclusion of 0 percent. With no one admitted to the class of 2020, Stanford is assured that no other school can match its desirability in the near future. \u201cWe had exceptional applicants, yes, but not a single student we couldn\u2019t live without,\u201d said a Stanford administrator who requested anonymity. \u201cIn the stack of applications that I reviewed, I didn\u2019t see any gold medalists from the last Olympics \u2014 Summer or Winter Games \u2014 and while there was a 17-year-old who\u2019d performed surgery, it wasn\u2019t open-heart or a transplant or anything like that. She\u2019ll thrive at Yale.\u201d The piece concluded by stating: At first blush, Stanford\u2019s decision would seem to jeopardize its fund-raising. The thousands of rejected applicants included hundreds of children of alumni who\u2019d donated lavishly over the years, their expectations obvious in the fact that they affixed their $50,000 checks to photographs of Emma playing an obscure woodwind in an Umbrian chamber orchestra or Scott donning the traditional dress of an indigenous people for whom he tailored a special social-media network while on spring break. In fact just 12 hours after the university\u2019s rejection of all comers, an alumnus stepped forward with a financial gift prodigious enough for Stanford to begin construction on its long-planned Center for Social Justice, a first-ever collaboration of Renzo Piano and Santiago Calatrava, who also designed the pedestrian bridge that will connect it to the student napping meadows. While many readers immediately picked up on the column\u2019s satirical nature, others didn\u2019t spot the joke despite the article\u2019s heavy-handed absurdity. \u201cCollege Admissions Shocker\u201d quickly appeared on the list of top Twitter trends:  For anyone planning to apply to Stanford: be warned. https://t.co/iLHflaLAbj \u2014 Victoria Huggler (@HugglerVictoria) March 30, 2016       Shocking college admissions decision out of Stanford: https://t.co/lGGgKbzTdR #sachat #EMchat #studentaffairs \u2014 Stacy OliverSikorski (@StacyLOliver) March 30, 2016 WTF, seriously, @Stanford? via @nytimes https://t.co/qtJkiwf1HR pic.twitter.com/U8gfCQXvQV \u2014 Davide Soleil (@Rex_Soleil) March 30, 2016   The Times did little to clarify the ambiguity, tweeting from their verified Op-Ed account:  .@FrankBruni on Stanford\u2019s acceptance rates reaching a new low https://t.co/ABb9PdrEwe \u2014 NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) March 30, 2016   Frank Bruni: Elite schools mortified by acceptance rates still north of 6% attempt to out-do Stanford. https://t.co/veWktcb1pk \u2014 NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) March 30, 2016     The piece was also shared to their Facebook page as though it were a straightforward news story:    Stanford\u2019s acceptance rates have reached a new low, writes Frank Bruni. Posted by The New York Times Opinion Section on Wednesday, March 30, 2016         Bruni didn\u2019t tweet anything directly about the nature of his column, but he did retweet a mention that referred to it as a \u201clampoon\u201d:  At Penn we\u2019re just happy to be mentioned in @FrankBruni\u2018s elite college admissions lampoon.https://t.co/n6FnVgU15Y pic.twitter.com/t85qn9Z6hA \u2014 Ian Petrie (@icpetrie) March 30, 2016  The column was contradicted by content published to Stanford University\u2019s own Facebook page on 25 March 2016 noting that they had accepted 2,063 students for the upcoming academic year:    Congratulations to the 2,063 students \u2014 from 50 states and 76 countries \u2014 offered undergraduate admission to the Class of 2020. Posted by Stanford University on Friday, March 25, 2016   While social media users poked fun at those who didn\u2019t immediately get Frank Bruni\u2019s \u201cCollege Admissions Shocker!\u201d joke, the New York Times\u2018 presentation of the piece didn\u2019t explicitly state it was satire.  Some readers might have believed the column to be on the level because the ins-and-outs of elite college admissions remain an arcane subject, the paper published it to social media channels without qualification (and using a standard Times-branded graphic), and both the column and the posts were dated 30 March 2016 (not 1 April, a date that people associate with tomfoolery).

    "content": " On June 3, 2020, The New York Times published an op-ed by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton entitled \u201cSend in the Troops,\u201d which argued that President Donald Trump should use military force to put an end to the nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice that followed the killing of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody. The op-ed sparked backlash, with many arguing that giving publicity to such an opinion put the lives of protesters, as well as black staffers at The New York Times, in danger. The New York News Guild also released a statement that they were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the publishing of this column.  As the backlash grew online, some argued that The New York Times\u2019 publishing of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise since \u201cThe Gray Lady\u201d had also published an op-ed by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler back in 1941.         This is a genuine image of an article that was published in New York Times Magazine in 1941. However, \u201cop-ed\u201d may not be the best descriptor for this content, as it is actually an excerpt from Hitler\u2019s manifesto \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d  It was preceded by an introductory paragraph explaining that Germany was at that time waging a war of propaganda against the United States based on principles Hitler himself outlined in the excerpt:  Germany is now waging a psychological war against this country as well as a military war in other parts of the world. That psychological war is based on the principles of propaganda laid down by Adolf Hitler in his autobiography \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d Below the book\u2019s most important passages on propaganda are published. This was therefore not a case of the Times providing op-ed space for a particular political view, but rather to educate its readers about the propaganda methods being used against Americans by the Nazis.

    "claim": "On June 21, 2021, mayoral candidate Andrew Yang said hospitalizing people with severe mental illness is the only way to \"supercharge our economic recovery.\"",
    "content": " On June 21, 2021, the day before New York City\u2019s mayoral primary election, a New York Times reporter claimed one of the Democratic candidates \u2014 Andrew Yang \u2014 said on a conservative talk radio show that people with mental illnesses need to be hospitalized in order for the city\u2019s economy to improve.  According to a tweet by the Times journalist, Emma Fitzsimmons, billionaire John Catsimatidis and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani had just spoken with Yang on 77 WABC\u2019s \u201cElection Coverage\u201d show. Fitzsimmons said in the post, which hundreds of users retweeted for their own followers, at 4:18 (EST):  The attribution was correct.       According to 77 WABC\u2019s video recording of the June 21 broadcast segment, which featured candidates of several New York races fielding questions from Catsimatidis and Giuliani, Yang phoned into the show and had the below-transcribed exchange: Yang: We\u2019re poised to win this race, and then I\u2019m going to get to work on delivering for New Yorkers the public safety we expect and deserve, which includes getting the homeless men who are struggling mentally into environments where they\u2019re safer and healthier. It\u2019s better for everyone. [\u2026] Catsimatidis: One of the most important things with law and order in New York City, is we have all of these homeless people in the streets and lot of them are mentally ill. [\u2026] What happened? Don\u2019t those people deserve treatment? Aren\u2019t we better of spending money to build hospitals to treat those poor people? Yang: 100 percent. We need to get them the care that they need, but that will also supercharge our economic recovery because we all see these mentally ill people on our streets and subways, and you know who else sees them? Tourists. And then they don\u2019t come back, and they tell their friends, \u2018Don\u2019t go to New York City.\u2019 We\u2019re never going to get our jobs back and our economy back if we don\u2019t get the mentally ill people who are on our streets in a better environment. It\u2019s going to be worth every penny. In other words,Yang did not explicitly say hospitalizing people with severe mental health issues was \u201cthe only way\u201d (verbatim) to restart the city\u2019s economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, he did say \u201cwe\u2019re never going to get our jobs back and our economy back\u201d without supposedly taking the step, implying the same thing. Hours after the radio interview, Yang told The New York Times that he stood by his comments on the radio show, again framing the issue as one of public safety. \u201cWe all know that public safety is top of mind for New Yorkers,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThere will not be an economic recovery until people feel safe walking our streets and walking our subways.\u201d It was not the first instance of Yang, a former presidential candidate, saying people with severe mental issues perpetuate some of the city\u2019s economic and social problems. During a debate on June 16 with other Democratic candidates (there are 13 total), Yang said city officials need to get people with untreated mental health issues \u201coff of our streets and our subways into a better environment,\u201d and that \u201cmentally ill homeless men are changing the character of our neighborhoods,\u201d presumably for the worse. \u201cYes, mentally ill people have rights, but you know who else have rights? We do: the people and families of the city,\u201d Yang said at the debate. \u201cWe have the right to walk the street and not fear for our safety because a mentally ill person is going to lash out at us.\u201d Those comments sparked criticism among social media users who pointed out research that shows people with severe mental illness are far more likely to be victims of crime \u2014 not perpetrators \u2014 and the fact that mental health includes a wide spectrum of disorders that affect everyone. The day after the debate, Yang responded to that outcry with the below-displayed tweet.  \u201cFull context here was mental illness is behind half of anti-Asian hate crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get them compassionate comprehensive care \u2014 and not let them languish on our streets.\u201d ",

    "claim": "New York Times columnist hailed the election of Donald Trump as a \"complete repudiation of Barack Obama.\"",
    "content": " It is well known that New York Times political columnist Maureen Dowd is not a fan of President-elect Donald Trump (nor he of her, for that matter, having called Dowd \u201cwacky\u201d and a \u201cneurotic dope\u201d in angry tweets), so Facebook users were quite surprised to see blurbs in their news feeds a month or so after the election for an column in which she seemingly hailed Trump\u2019s election as a welcome corrective to eight years of rule by liberal Democrats: The most amazing part of this well written piece is the fact Maureen Dowd, a liberal columnist from the New York Times wrote it! Maureen Dowd Election Therapy From My Basket of Deplorables The election was a complete repudiation of Barack Obama: his fantasy world of political correctness, the politicization of the Justice Department and the I.R.S., an out-of-control E.P.A., his neutering of the military, his nonsupport of the police and his fixation on things like transgender bathrooms. Since he became president, his party has lost 63 House seats, 10 Senate seats and 14 governorships. The country had signaled strongly in the last two midterms that they were not happy. The Dems\u2019 answer was to give them more of the same from a person they did not like or trust. Preaching \u2014 and pandering \u2014 with a message of inclusion, the Democrats have instead become a party where incivility and bad manners are taken for granted, rudeness is routine, religion is mocked and there is absolutely no respect for a differing opinion. This did not go down well in the Midwest, where Trump flipped three blue states and 44 electoral votes\u2026. It continues in that vein. Not to minimize the pleasure Trump voters must have felt reading such an articulate defense of their choice of candidates, but Maureen Dowd did not, in fact, write the bulk of that column, even though it carried her byline. Some of the folks who copied and pasted it onto their Facebook pages omitted critical paragraphs at the beginning of the article announcing that what was to follow was written by a member of Dowd\u2019s own \u201clittle basket of deplorables, as I call my conservative family\u201d \u2014 her Republican brother, Kevin. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that introduction: My colleague Paul Krugman tweeted Friday that \u201caffluent, educated suburbanites\u201d who voted for Trump are \u201cfools.\u201d What else is there to say, he asked. Well, here is what Kevin, an affluent, educated suburbanite has to say in his column, titled an \u201cElection Therapy Guide for Liberals.\u201d The column can be read in its entirety here. ",

    "claim": "The New York Times contradicted their 20 January 2017 report about wire tapping in an article entitled \"Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones.\"",
    "content": " In March 2017, several web outlets circulated an image purportedly showing the front page of the 20 January 2017 print edition of the New York Times along with accusations that the newspaper\u2019s reporting on President Trump\u2019s claims that former President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower phones had been contradictory:  The front page of The New York Times way back on January 20, 2017\u2026 \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\u201d But Two months later they are trashing their own reports! Now the NY Times is reporting there is no evidence of a wiretap. No wonder nobody trusts them! The image is of the Times\u2018 front page and its \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\u201d is real. It\u2019s also true that the New York Times reported about two months later that President Trump had offered no evidence to back up his claim that the Obama administration had tapped his phones. However, these two articles are not contradictory In order for the New York Times 4 March 2017 report (\u201cTrump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones\u201d) to contradict the newspaper\u2019s 20 January 2017 report (\u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\u201d), the paper would have had to have provided evidence (or at least asserted) that the earlier article was based on an Obama administration wiretap of Trump\u2019s phones. This, of course, was not the case.  Although the Janaury article did use the words \u201cwiretapped\u201d and \u201cTrump\u201d in its title, it did not state that Trump Tower telephones were specifically targeted by a wiretap initiated by the Obama administration. Rather, the article stated that intelligence agencies were monitoring Russian officials, and that some of the conversations they intercepted in the course of their investigations may have also involved Trump aides: Counterintelligence investigations examine the connections between American citizens and foreign governments. Those connections can involve efforts to steal state or corporate secrets, curry favor with American government leaders or influence policy. It is unclear which Russian officials are under investigation, or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigations is low, and prosecutions are rare.       Furthermore, the article stated that it was still unclear if the intercepted communications were linked to the Trump campaign, or Trump himself, at all:  --> It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself. It is also unclear whether the inquiry has anything to do with an investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers and other attempts to disrupt the elections in November. The American government has concluded that the Russian government was responsible for a broad computer hacking campaign, including the operation against the D.N.C. This article, which was also published online under the title \u201cIntercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates,\u201d was cited in a 3 March 2017 Breitbart report which many pundits believe was the basis for President Trump\u2019s wiretap claim again his predecessor. Although radio host Mark Levin collected several reports related to wiretapping and Trump\u2019s alleged connections with Russia, no evidence has yet surfaced showing that the Obama administration had initiated a wiretap of Trump Tower phones: The problem here, of course, is that what Levin \u2014 and Breitbart \u2014 use as evidence for these claims are a series of seemingly unconnected events \u2014 from FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court requests to Trump joking about the Russia email hack, to the release of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails in the fall. The proof that all \u2014 or any \u2014 of these events are tied together by actual facts as opposed to supposition is not offered. The White House has offered no further evidence of Trump\u2019s claims \u2014 as of this publishing. Matt Rosenberg, one of the authors of the above-quoted Times article, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that nowhere in his reporting did it state that Trump himself was under surveillance:   \u201cIf we knew now, that they were monitoring Donald Trump\u2019s communications\u2026we would be saying that\u201d @AllMattNYT https://t.co/PRenVfFvtt \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) March 8, 2017  Cooper: Does your reporting in any way suggest the claim the president is making that President Obama tapped then-candidate trump\u2019s phone? Rosenberg: Nowhere in this story does it say that. It says that there is a broad investigation based on wiretapped and intercepted communications. It does not say whose communications were intercepted. I\u2019d also point readers, and something that people conveniently leave out, to another story we published last week on March 1 that explicitly says that much of the communications were Russians talking to Russians. They were hearing about things through those conversations. Is there a FISA warrant were there wiretaps on Donald Trump or any of his campaign people\u2019s phones? I don\u2019t know that. We don\u2019t know that. If we knew that it would absolutely be in the newspaper. Cooper: So the communications you were discussing in the article were Russians talking to Russians? Rosenberg: They are Russians talking to Russians. The communication in the 19th article, I can\u2019t get into the sourcing very deeply, But I can tell you absolutely that if we knew at that time or if we knew now that they were monitoring Donald trump\u2019s communications, or any of his advisers regularly, and we could say that explicitly, we would be saying that in the newspaper. That is a news story. And the same thing goes with Michael Flynn. They bring up Michael Flynn\u2019s communications with the Russian ambassador. He was picked up talking because he was talking to the Russian ambassador whose phone was absolutely monitored. And have been probably monitoring Russian ambassadors for what, 70 years now. That\u2019s why [Flynn] was picked up. They weren\u2019t tracking Michael Flynn or wiretapping his calls. They were listening to the Russian ambassador and [Flynn] got on the phone with him and started talking and that\u2019s why he was heard. Cooper: I want to read the line from your article that mentions the word \u2018wiretapping.\u2019 It says: \u2018One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.\u2019 Do you have any sense of who was being wiretapped? Was that the Russian-to-Russian communications? Rosenberg: I want to get careful on that. I don\u2019t want to get into who was being wiretapped. But saying that it was \u2018provided to the White House\u2019 is not the same as saying that it was Trump. And one thing that I want to get clear and something I don\u2019t think most people understand is that in most cases when people are on the phone \u2014 say two foreign officials are talking about an American \u2014 the name of that American is going to be masked. It\u2019s going to be blacked out. Only certain people can have it unmasked. Only under certain conditions can it be unmasked. If you need it for context in a security situation you could. People may be able to figure out from context who it is, but the name isn\u2019t ordinarily available in reports that are distributed in the intelligence community. When Rosenberg was pressed on the issue by CNN commentator Jeffrey Lord, he responded that \u201conly the most obtuse misreading\u201d of the article would lead one to conclude that Donald Trump was under surveillance.

    "claim": "New York Times columnist David Brooks said that Donald Trump needed to decide if he'd rather 'resign, be impeached, or get assassinated.'",
    "content": " On 12 November 2016, the disreputable web site The Rightists published a hoax news article reporting that New York Times columnist David Brooks said that Donald Trump would \u2018resign, be impeached, or get assassinated\u2019 within the first six months of his presidency:  From Brooks\u2019 column: \u201cFinally, it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result\u2026Trump\u2019s bigotry, dishonesty and promise-breaking will have to be denounced. We can\u2019t go morally numb. But he needs to be replaced with a program that addresses the problems that fueled his assent. After all, the guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year.\u201d However, while commenting on his column in a subsequent interview with KYRQ Radio in New York City, Brooks said, \u201cOh, and by the way \u2013 I forgot to mention \u2018assassinated.\u2019\u201d The columnist then went on to say that \u201cthe whole \u2018pen is mightier than the sword\u2019 philosophy might have worked if we were talking about Hillary Clinton, but when it comes to Donald Trump, you don\u2019t really need a pen, because he\u2019ll bury himself soon enough.\u201d \u201cAt the rate he\u2019s going, I\u2019m starting to wonder if he\u2019ll make it through the first six months, let alone an entire year,\u201d Brooks said. The Rightists is a \u201chybrid\u201d web site that publishes stories containing a mixture of true and inaccurate information: This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true! In this case, it is true that Brooks wrote a column in which he stated that Trump would probably \u201cresign or be impeached within a year.\u201d However, the part where Brooks later went on a radio show and said that he forgot to mention \u201cassassinated\u201d is untrue. While The Rightists claimed that Brooks made his comments on the New York radio station KYRQ, no such station exists in New York, although there is a KYRQ in Natalia, Texas (and since New York is east of the Mississippi River, the call letters of any radio station there would begin with \u201cW,\u201d not \u201cK.\u201d) Furthermore, this site is the only source for Brooks\u2019 alleged comments. If the New York Times columnist truly had made such inflammatory remarks, there would be more than one obscure web site reporting the story. The Rightists has previously published fake news stories claiming that Joe Biden called American women \u201clazy,\u201d that Tim Kaine threatened to ban the Catholic Church from the United States, and that Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump would make a great president during a 2013 speech.

    "claim": "Nearly 20 percent of Donald Trump\u2019s voters disagreed with the freeing of slaves in Southern states after the Civil War.",
    "content": " On 23 February 2016, New York Times\u2019 \u201cThe Upshot\u201d published an item reporting that one in five Trump supporters don\u2019t believe slaves should have been freed:  Defining Trump\u2019s coalition: Are whites superior? Should slaves have been freed? Take a look at my @UpshotNYT take. https://t.co/KfxPvC4Hkg \u2014 Lynn Vavreck (@vavreck) February 23, 2016 The piece largely focused on a \u201cnew set of public opinion survey results asking atypical but timely questions [which] has shed some light on the Trump coalition,\u201d pulling together multiple data sets for a broader look at candidates\u2019 voter bases. But readers and pundits focused on one particular portion at the tail end of the article:  Nationally, the YouGov data show a similar trend: Nearly 20 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters disagreed with the freeing of slaves in Southern states after the Civil War. Only 5 percent of Mr. Rubio\u2019s voters share this view. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with white, working-class voters who are more likely than other Republicans to believe that whites are a supreme race and who long for the Confederacy may make him unpopular among leaders in his party. But it\u2019s worth noting that he isn\u2019t persuading voters to hold these beliefs. The beliefs were there \u2014 and have been for some time. The \u201cone in five Trump supporters support slavery\u201d claim originated with the following question from a joint poll conducted by polling outfit YouGov and The Economist. The verbiage included the modifier \u201cexecutive order\u201d:  Do you approve or disapprove of the executive order which freed all slaves in states that were in rebellion against the federal government?       Of the 2,000 respondents, 53 percent said they strongly approved; 17 percent approved somewhat; 8 percent disapproved somewhat; 5 percent disapproved strongly; and 17 percent said they were not sure. Another report, this by Public Policy Polling, appeared to suggest likely Republican voters who identified as \u201cvery liberal\u201d or \u201csomewhat liberal\u201d were likelier than those \u201cvery conservative\u201d or \u201csomewhat conservative\u201d to indicate \u201cwhites [were] a superior race\u201d:  The same question was not asked of likely Democrat respondents. PPP provided the following methodology for that poll data collection:  Public Policy Polling surveyed 897 likely Republican primary voters and 525 Democratic primary voters on February 14th and 15th. The margin of error is +/-3.3% for the Republicans and +/-4.3% for the Democrats. 80% of participants, selected through a list based sample, responded via the phone, while 20% of respondents who did not have landlines conducted the survey over the internet through an opt-in internet panel. That poll appeared to involve 30 percent of 897 likely Republican voters, or approximately 296 individuals. Of those 296 voters, it appeared 112 Trump supporters indicated they wished the South had won the Civil War. And again, the effect of those responses was buffered by the \u201cideology\u201d breakdown for that question, which appeared to indicate a higher rate of affirmatives among self-identified liberal likely Republican  voters, not conservative ones. We searched YouGov\u2019s site for similar polling data in an attempt to locate the core polling data in question, and found a December 2014 piece about general approval for (or disapproval of) the use of executive orders:  Many dislike executive orders as a matter of principle, though that doesn\u2019t mean that the public opposes some of the most important orders in American history \u2026 The public was even more supportive \u2013 at least to the concept of a president occasionally using an executive order \u2014 after it was reminded of specific executive orders, including freeing the slaves in the parts of the country that was in rebellion (the Emancipation Proclamation) and the desegregation of the military. Republicans and Democrats agreed that these were appropriate executive orders. But the percentages supporting the use of executive orders in the two popular historical cases has dropped a bit from February. Directly beneath it was an interesting breakdown (unrelated to anything Trump) of answers to the same question provided by respondents in 2014:  Before Trump ever entered the ring, between 12 and 15 percent of respondents indicated they disapproved of the executive order which freed the Southern slaves.  This divide appeared to hinge less on slavery than an ideological opposition among some Americans for executive orders in general. YouGov reported:  This distaste for solo executive orders in principle extends far beyond the issue of immigration: many in the latest Economist/YouGov Poll oppose them in principle. That\u2019s particularly true for Republicans, many of whom are adamant about not permitting executive actions \u2013 even for mundane changes in administrative issues \u2013 without Congressional approval.  The partisan divide seen in so many poll questions extends to principles that are now seen as partisan.  Nearly all of the examples of solo executive actions offered in the Economist/YouGov Poll were of executive orders issued by Republican President George W. Bush, though this was not specified.  Republicans were consistently less likely than Democrats to support these actions, with the exception of ordering reserves to active duty.  In that case a plurality of both Republicans and Democrats say a President should be able to do that.  This question, then, has long been interpreted as something of an ideological purity test about unilateral executive action. If a January or February 2016 poll indicated that 20 percent of Trump\u2019s base answered the question about slavery in the affirmative, that was not a sharp divergence from general polling data in November 2014 involving the same question. Back then (and prior to Trump\u2019s campaign announcement), between 12 and 15 percent of Americans indicated disapproval of that (and all) executive orders. On 25 February 2016, we spoke to Lynn Vavreck (a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and author of the New York Times piece), who explained:  I analyzed the raw data. Basically, I just got the idea that it would be interesting to see if there were differences \u2014 take the YouGov data and see are there differences across the candidates\u2019 backers, and whether they agree or disagree with the Emancipation Proclamation.  The money here is in the comparison. The number itself, the 20 percent of Trump supporters\u2026 you need to compare that to Rubio\u2019s supporters, which is at 4 percent. So this is one more brush stroke on this canvas that says Trump supporters look different than Rubio supporters. So that\u2019s it \u2014 it\u2019s the comparison.       At 6:52 PM EST on 25 February 2016, YouGov released the specific breakdown of responses by candidate:  Here are full tables breaking down approval of the Emancipation Proclamation by GOP presidential nominee preference: https://t.co/XvBaX0TTHK \u2014 YouGovUS (@YouGovUS) February 25, 2016  That data displayed as follows:  YouGov\u2019s release of the full tables was the first reference we were able to find showing the breakdown per candidate. By combining those who \u201cdisapproved strongly\u201d and \u201cdisapproved somewhat\u201d of the Emancipation Proclamation, we reached a figure of 20 percent for supporters of Donald Trump, higher than any other candidate. Both Cruz and Huckabee\u2019s supporters polled at 15 percent, and Bush\u2019s at 12 percent. Although Trump beat the others in the sum of those responses, it was not by a shocking amount, contrasted with the majority of Republican frontrunners at the time the poll was conducted. Vavreck contrasted Trump\u2019s 20 percent with Rubio\u2019s five, but Kasich was notably more of an outlier with a very modest three percent rating. Shortly after YouGov tweeted a link to the previously-unavailable data, USA Today\u2018s David Mastio tweeted us a link to an editorial about the claim:  @KimLaCapria That poll where 20% of Trump supporters disapprove of abolition of slavery? BS https://t.co/NbxsdZIi0Z \u2026 \u2014 David Mastio (@DavidMastio) February 26, 2016        The paper further analyzed the massive larger report, and provided additional context for the purported indictment of Trump\u2019s base: In the same Economist /YouGov poll:   15% of American Hispanics agree with those racist Trump supporters \u2026 A quarter of Hispanics are not sure. 32% of American blacks back President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s decision to round up Japanese-Americans and put them in camps during World War II \u2026 almost exactly the same percentage as among Trump voters. More than 30% of those UNDER 30 are not sure that President Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 executive order desegregating the U.S. military was a good idea. 15% are sure it wasn\u2019t. 43% of likely Democratic primary voters, a very liberal slice of America, approve of President George W. Bush\u2019s pro-torture executive order after 9/11.   So, are America\u2019s Hispanics nearly as racist as Trump supporters? Do a third of African-Americans have it in for their Asian countrymen? Are kids raised in the 1980s and later more resistant to desegregation than Americans born when Jim Crow was a thing? Do liberals love waterboarding? \u2026 If you dig deep into the confusing Economist/YouGov online poll, you find that only 71% of American blacks approve of the Emancipation Proclamation. Five percent definitely disapprove of Lincoln\u2019s action and 24% just aren\u2019t sure. The data shifted yet again when viewed through a different lens:  Although 20 percent of likely Trump voters indicated they disapproved of the executive order that freed slaves, 71 percent of white respondents in total said they approved of it (leaving 29 percent presumably in the \u201cdisapproval\u201d category). Bizarrely, that number was static for black voters of all parties, and reached only 60 percent for Hispanic voters. Put another way, a different approach to these numbers would suggest more black voters than Trump supporters disapproved of the Emancipation Proclamation (somehow, that didn\u2019t make it into the news cycle). On 26 February 2016, a representative from YouGov clarified that the breakdown was calculated by Vavrick, and provided numbers for Democratic frontrunners Sanders and Clinton about the \u201cslavery\u201d question. Of Sanders supporters, 81.5 approved and 9.8 percent disapproved, and 85.3 percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters approved, while 6.2 percent disapproved. It remained true Trump carried the largest share of disapprovers of the \u201cEmancipation Proclamation\u201d question, but that effect of that statistical \u201cbrush stroke\u201d appeared less broad on the larger canvas of a diverse American electorate motivated by a number of factors.
