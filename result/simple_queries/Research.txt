    "claim": "New research has uncovered that the true cause of fibromyalgia is an excess number of specific nerves found near a specific kind of blood vessel in the hands and feet, ending the controversy over the disease\u2019s cause and mechanism.",
    "content": " Since at least June 2013, a nearly identical article has appeared on a number of websites with the headline \u201cFibromyalgia Mystery Finally Solved!\u201d These stories, which continue to appear online, begin with the same claim:  Researchers have found the main source of pain in Fibromyalgia patients, and contrary to what many believe, it does not stem from the brain. The findings mark the end of a decades-old mystery about the disease, which many doctors believed was conjured in patients\u2019 imaginations. [\u2026] Up until recently, many physicians thought that the disease was \u201cimaginary\u201d or psychological, but scientists have now revealed that the main source of pain stems from a most unlikely place \u2014 excess blood vessels in the hand, legs and foot.  Fibromyalgia is is an enigmatic condition that disproportionately affects women; it is associated with clinically unexplained pain, potentially combined with other symptoms of unknown medical origin. As reported in a 2014 review paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association:  Fibromyalgia may be considered as a discrete diagnosis or as a constellation of symptoms characterized by central nervous system pain amplification with concomitant fatigue, memory problems, and sleep and mood disturbances.  Before diving into the research claims made in this \u201cfibromyalgia solved\u201d brand of clickbait, it is important to mention that framing the issue as a debate between those who think the pain is \u201cimaginary\u201d and those who think it is \u201creal\u201d is an extremely reductive description of the medical hypotheses surrounding fibromyalgia, and, indeed, of pain itself.       The most common explanation for the symptoms that present as fibromyalgia in the scientific literature is a phenomenon dubbed \u201ccentral sensitization\u201d, in which the central nervous system (either through physical trauma or another cause) lowers its threshold for registering external signals as pain. As described in a 2009 review:  Instead [of being caused by an external factor], central sensitization represents an abnormal state of responsiveness or increased gain of the nociceptive system [the part of the sensory nervous system that sends pain signals]. The pain is effectively generated as a consequence of changes within the [central nervous system] that then alter how it responds to sensory inputs, rather than reflecting the presence of [a physical source of pain].  While central sensitization may not have an external source, the pain is no more \u201creal\u201d or \u201cimaginary\u201d than any other pain caused by an actual physical stimulus. The study referenced in the viral stories, published in 2013 in the journal Pain Medicine, makes an argument for a physical, detectable source of the condition. The study focused on a specific kind of blood vessel in the hand \u2014 arteriole venule shunts \u2014 that can direct blood flow to bypass the hands in response to temperature, as described in a 2013 press release from the University of Albany, where the research was conducted:  In humans, these types of shunts are unique to the palms of our hands and soles of our feet which work like the radiator in a car. Under warm conditions, the shunts close down to force blood into the capillaries at the surface of the skin in order to radiate heat from the body, and our hands get sweaty. Under cold conditions, the shunts open wide allowing blood to bypass the capillaries in order to conserve heat, and our hands get cold and put on gloves.  The researchers, who were also associated with a biotech company (INTiDYN) that developed the imaging technique used in the study, analyzed biopsies from 24 female patients with fibromyalgia and compared them to a number of healthy control subjects. The authors found that there was a significant excess number of nerves around these shunts in the fibromyalgia patient\u2019s hands. The senior author on the paper, Frank Rice, explained the potential significance of the findings in their press release:  \u201cInstead of being in the brain, the pathology consists of excessive sensory nerve fibers around specialized blood vessel structures located in the palms of the hands,\u201d said Dr. Rice, President of Intidyn and the senior researcher on the study. \u201cThis discovery provides concrete evidence of a fibromyalgia-specific pathology which can now be used for diagnosing the disease, and as a novel starting point for developing more effective therapeutics.\u201d  Outside of providing an explanation for fibromyalgia pain, the authors suggest this mechanism could also relate to other symptoms commonly associated with the condition:  In human and nonhuman primates, the [hair-free skin found on the hands and feet] plays a major role in thermoregulation and the maintenance of core body temperature as well as the apportionment of blood to other organs such as skeletal muscle during periods of high metabolic demand. Therefore, [an excess of nerves near arteriole venule shunts in the hair free skin on the hands of fibromyalgia] patients may contribute to extreme tenderness and pain in the hands, but may also contribute to the chronic widespread deep pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction associated with [fibromyalgia].  While the study is real, it was limited in its scope due to its low sample size. Further, it does not appear to have shifted the debate away from hypotheses that revolve primarily around central sensitization, despite claims that the mystery had been \u201csolved\u201d. A 2015 review on the condition released by the Mayo Clinic describes the state of the field:  Earlier there was some doubt about whether there was an \u201corganic basis\u201d for these related conditions, but today there is irrefutable evidence from brain imaging and other techniques that this condition has strong biological underpinnings, even though psychological, social, and behavioral factors clearly play prominent roles in some patients. The pathophysiological hallmark is a sensitized or hyperactive central nervous system that leads to an increased volume control or gain on pain and sensory processing.  While the study is real and their specific results are not in question, it was neither new as of 2017, nor did it substantively change the debate on the cause of fibromyalgia, much less \u201csolve the mystery\u201d. As such, we rank the claim as mostly false. ",

    "claim": "The Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization gives only 20% of their donations to cancer research and pays their CEO $684,000 per year.",
    "content": "  When Susan Goodman Komen died of breast cancer at the age of 33 in 1980, her younger sister, Nancy Goodman Brinker promised she would do whatever she could to help end that disease.  Brinker fulfilled that promise by founding The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation (later known as Susan G. Komen for the Cure, then just Susan G. Komen) in 1982, a group that has since become the largest and most well known breast cancer organization in the United States:  Brinker fulfilled a promise to her sister that she would do everything she could to help eradicate the disease \u2014 a disease that Brinker also was diagnosed with and successfully fought. \u201cAt that time, there was a stigma and shame around breast cancer,\u201d Brinker said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t talk about it. There were no 800-numbers, no Internet. Our government didn\u2019t spend much on breast cancer research. There were few major cancer centers with expertise about breast cancer. That\u2019s the world we faced when Suzy was diagnosed. It\u2019s a world I watched her suffer in, and it\u2019s a world she wanted us to change.\u201d  In 2012, Komen founder and CEO Nancy Brinker became the focus of controversy when she announced Komen would be pulling the grants the organization had been providing to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screenings, then quickly reversed that decision.  Several months later Brinker announced she would be stepping down as Komen\u2019s CEO, but the following year she was again the focus of controversy when news outlets reported that not only did she still hold her CEO position, but she had received a hefty raise to boot that brought her annual compensation up to $684,000 per year:  In early 2012, Komen announced it was pulling its grants for breast-cancer screenings from Planned Parenthood, drawing an immediate backlash from Komen supporters and abortion rights advocates. Within days, Nancy Brinker, the group\u2019s founder and CEO, reversed the decision to defund the organization. Then, in August, Brinker announced that she would be stepping down. But 10 months later, Brinker still holds her position and tax documents reveal that she received a 64 percent raise and now makes $684,000 a year, according to the charity\u2019s latest available tax filing.  Komen says the raise came in November 2010, prior to last year\u2019s controversy. Ken Berger, president and CEO of Charity Navigator, which evaluates and rates charities, called Brinker\u2019s salary \u201cextremely high.\u201d \u201cThis pay package is way outside the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size. This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making, for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross.\u201d  The American Red Cross had revenue of about $3.4 billion, while Komen\u2019s was about $340 million last year.  Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern makes $500,000, according to the most recent financial documents available for the charity.        Charity Navigator\u2019s last compensation figure for Nancy Brinker was $560,896 per year, which at the time put her below Komen president Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s reported annual compensation of $606,461.   In June 2013, Komen finally announced that Brinker would be stepping down as president and CEO of that organization and named Judith A. Salerno, M.D. as her successor.  In June 2015, Brinker reportedly resigned from her paid position to assume an unpaid role role as a top volunteer with Komen. Dr. Salerno\u2019s most recently reported compensation (in August 2017) was $479,858, while Nancy Brinker was still listed as a \u201cfounder\u201d receiving a salary of $397,093. In September 2017, Paula Schneider took over as president and CEO of Komen, with compensation of $137,155 reported as of the end of the fiscal year in March 2018. The reference to Komen\u2019s applying only 20% of donated money to breast cancer research likely comes from a pie chart displayed in the \u201cUse of Funds\u201d section of Wikipedia\u2019s article about Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which showed Komen\u2019s 2009-2010 Expenses:  While it may have been true that breast cancer research comprised only a 21% share of Komen\u2019s program expenses (Charity Navigator puts the figure at 28.8% as of March 2018), citing that figure as a criticism of the organization reflects a common misbelief that groups dedicated to addressing particular diseases (e.g., the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the ALS Association) exist solely or primarily to fund and direct research into curing and/or preventing those diseases.  This perception is inaccurate: Komen and other groups like it have goals that include delivering a wide array of services to the communities they support beyond the funding of research, such as funding educational awareness and outreach programs, providing screening and diagnostic procedures, and arranging medical treatment and home care for persons currently living with those diseases.  A more relevant metric for assessing a charity\u2019s overall financial effectiveness is the percentage of the organization\u2019s budget that is actually spent on all the programs and services the charity delivers, and in this area the Charity Navigator charity evaluation site gives  Komen an 80.3 rating (as well as a 96.0 rating for Accountability &amp; Transparency).  Charity Navigator does rank many other breast cancer charities higher than Susan G. Komen for the Cure, however. Regarding the seemingly excessively high level of CEO salaries at some charities, Charity Navigator advises that:  While there are certainly some charities that overpay their leaders, Charity Navigator\u2019s data shows that those organizations are the minority. Among the charities we\u2019ve evaluated (those being mid to large-sized charities), the typical CEO\u2019s annual compensation is in the low to mid six figures. Before you make any judgments about salaries higher or lower than that range, we encourage you to keep in mind that these charities are complex organizations, with multi-million dollar budgets, hundreds of employees, and thousands of constituents. These leaders could inevitably make much more running similarly sized for-profit firms. Furthermore, when making your decision it is important to consider that it takes a certain level of professionalism to effectively run a charity and charities must offer a competitive salary if they want to attract and retain that level of leadership.

    "claim": "Did a Mexican researcher eliminate HPV in hundreds of women using photodynamic therapy?",
    "content": " Though it received comparatively little coverage in U.S. media outlets, a Mexican scientist\u2019s medical breakthrough in February 2019 was legitimate. Mexico\u2019s National Polytecnic Institute (IPN) announced on 3 February 2019 that a team led by Eva Ram\u00f3n Gallegos had developed a non-invasive treatment that eliminated the human papillomavirus in 29 women in Mexico City as well as in 420 women in the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz in past experiments. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the human papillomavirus, known as HPV for short, is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., with about 79 million Americans currently infected with some form of the virus. Around 14 variants of HPV can lead to a patient\u2019s developing cervical cancer, and the CDC reported that almost 12,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year. Ram\u00f3n Gallegos\u2019 work, which she has carried out for 20 years, involves the use of photodynamic therapy, in which a drug (referred to as a \u201cphotosensitizer\u201d) is injected into the HPV patient\u2019s bloodstream. The patient is later exposed to light through the use of a laser, or fiber-optic cables. For example, as the National Cancer Institute reported: Approximately 24 to 72 hours after injection, when most of the agent has left normal cells but remains in cancer cells, the tumor is exposed to light. The photosensitizer in the tumor absorbs the light and produces an active form of oxygen that destroys nearby cancer cells \u2026 The photosensitizer can damage blood vessels in the tumor, thereby preventing the cancer from receiving necessary nutrients. [The therapy] also may activate the immune system to attack the tumor cells. In her work, Ram\u00f3n Gallegos and her team employed a substance called 5-Aminolevulinic acid, which over the course of four hours becomes the fluorescent compound Protoporphyrin IX. After the compound accumulates within infected cells, IPN reported, those cells were susceptible to being affected by her team\u2019s laser. IPN reported that the treatment also helped patients dealing with what are referred to as premalignant lesions associated with the early states of cervical cancer, and some 64.3 percent of patients suffering from HPV and lesions had the virus eradicated through Ram\u00f3n Gallegos\u2019 work. We contacted IPN seeking comment on what the next stage will be for Ram\u00f3n Gallegos after her latest findings but did not hear back prior to publication. ",

    "claim": "A new tattoo ink changes color depending on a person's glucose levels, meaning people with diabetes can use it to check their blood sugar levels.",
    "content": " On 9 June 2017, the Dose Facebook page posted a meme claiming that a new kind of tattoo ink changes color based on blood sugar levels, providing a warning system for people with diabetes: This tattoo ink changes color when blood sugar levels rise or fall, so people with diabetes can monitor in real time.  The post had been shared more than 300,000 times as of 28 June 2017, and we have received several inquiries about its veracity.  It is, indeed, based on real research that students, postdoctoral fellows, and professors are undertaking at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School.  The DermalAbyss project has not yet been tested on human skin, and is at the \u201cproof of concept stage,\u201d according to a May 2017 report by the MIT Media Lab.  Traditional tattoo inks are replaced with biosensors whose colors change in response to variations in the interstitial fluid. It blends advances in biotechnology with traditional methods in tattoo artistry.        Interstitial fluid is a layer of fluid that surrounds cells within the body. Measuring the level of glucose (blood sugar) in the fluid is an important way for people with diabetes to keep their blood sugar at an appropriate level and avoid diabetic shock (severe hypoglycemia).  The ink changes color based on three different biochemical measures in the interstitial fluid: the pH level (acidity) changes the ink from pink to purple; the glucose level changes it from blue to brown; and the sodium and pH levels cause the ink light up at a higher intensity under ultraviolet light.  DermalAbyss: Possibilities of Biosensors as a Tattooed Interface from Fluid Interfaces on Vimeo. The MIT researchers are Katia Vega, Xin Liu, Viirj Kan and Nick Barry; those at Harvard include Ali Yetisen and Nan Jiang.        They theorize that the biosensors could eventually replace the current method commonly used by people with diabetes to test their glucose levels, which involves pricking the skin.  With DermalAbyss, we imagine the future where the painful procedure is replaced with a tattoo, of which the color [changes] from pink to purple based on the glucose levels. Thus, the user could monitor the color changes and the need of insulin. However, the tattoo ink has so far only been tested on the skin of a dead pig, and the researchers say \u201cthere are currently no plans to develop DermalAbyss as a product or to pursue clinical trials.\u201d So it\u2019s a little bit of a stretch to claim, as the Dose meme did, that the ink means \u201cpeople with diabetes can monitor [their blood sugar] in real time.\u201d This is the theory, and the project looks promising so far. But it\u2019s not yet at the stage where it can actually be used by people with diabetes.  ",

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In late June and early July 2020, Snopes readers asked whether Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s foremost immunologist, had stated that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was told to cancel funding for research into how coronavirus infections emerge in humans. Fauci, who leads the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made the statement when responding to a question while testifying, along with other coronavirus task force leaders, on June 23, 2020, before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The testimony came as the U.S. experienced a spike in reported COVID-19 cases. Although scientists believe that the novel coronavirus, the virus causing the COVID-19 disease pandemic, had animal origins before it infected humans, the Trump administration has promoted an unfounded conspiracy theory that the disease originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, where it was originally detected in the winter of 2019.       U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey asked Fauci about the grant, stating it didn\u2019t make any sense to him that funding for research on the coronavirus had been canceled \u201cwhile we are in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic,\u201d asking Fauci if he knew why the decision had been made. \u201cWhy was it canceled? It was canceled because the NIH was told to cancel it,\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but we were told to cancel it.\u201d The exchange can be heard right after the 4:36 mark in this C-SPAN video. Fauci later clarified to Politico that it was the White House specifically that directed NIH to cut off the funding. Funding for the research project, which was run by the U.S. non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, was pulled on April 24. The move raised suspicion that it was done for political reasons, as the science and technology outlet Ars Technica reported: The funding cut could set back critical research into preventing such disease spread, scientists say. They also expressed dismay that the decision was prompted by unfounded conspiracy theories and what some see as a wider attempt by the Trump administration to deflect criticism of its handling of the pandemic by blaming China for unleashing the disease. The move was criticized by scientists, who called it counterproductive in the fight against the pandemic. Because Fauci stated in public testimony that NIH was told to cancel a grant for coronavirus research and later clarified to Politico that it was the White House that had initiated cutting a research grant for the EcoHealth Alliance research, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d ",

    "claim": "The Trump Administration\u2019s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.",
    "content": " In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not \u201csufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.\u201d Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting \u201ca comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved\u201d \u2014 in effect putting a \u201cpause\u201d on all research that relied on fetal tissue. ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:  Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. Potential drugs can then be tested in such a group, with ample mice as controls, giving the studies robust statistical power.  ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory\u2019s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:  Experiments in FY2016 revealed that our \u2026 humanized mouse model can be used in long-term studies (up to one year) with [Antiretroviral Therapy, ART] administered by injections or via an oral route (drugs incorporated into mouse chow). Such mice develop chronic and latent HIV infections. We have demonstrated that HIV viral loads in these mice can be suppressed to levels undetectable by highly sensitive PCR tests for viremia and provirus.        Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told Science that the HHS \u201cpause\u201d on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:  What happened in September was that my NIH collaborator at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories [Kim Hasenkrug] was informed that he could no longer order fetal tissue from the sole source supplier, ABR, and so we [were told that we] could complete the [initial] experiment that [had already been set up], but in science you need to do multiple experiments. You can\u2019t depend upon one experiment to see whether it\u2019s repeatable, etc. So essentially this ban on fetal tissue stopped the line of investigation.  Speaking to Science, Greene said that \u201cHasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML\u2019s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.\u201d In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to Science after the publication\u2019s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think \u2014 or realize \u2014 such a move would have affected the study in question:  [In their statement, the NIH] said the agency in September \u201cput a pause in place\u201d for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, \u201can action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements. Research with tissue already on hand could proceed, and NIH leaders asked to be notified by intramural investigators if new procurement would be necessary. NIH leadership was not informed that new procurement was necessary for the study you reference in your [7 December 2018 Science story]. We are looking into why this did not occur.\u201d  In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. \u201cTo my knowledge \u2026 we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.\u201d If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have \u201cacted upon it in a millisecond.\u201d We also reached out to the director of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review\u2019s impact on the study but have not received a response. However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they \u201cput a pause in place\u201d on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration\u2019s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists\u2019 efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is \u201cclearly a policy that\u2019s \u2026 reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that\u2019s now impacting our science.\u201d Greene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in Science:  On 11 September, 45 anti-abortion groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that they were \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d by the FDA contract [with ABR]. On 17 September, 85 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb asking him to cancel the contract. Reacting to HHS\u2019s actions [on 24 September], Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said: \u201cMy instinct is that this is driven by politics, and is part of the overall effort to stigmatize and eventually criminalize abortion, as well as part of a larger campaign to roll back the clock on sexual and reproductive rights.\u201d  Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.

    "claim": "New research suggests that Marmite helps combat premature ejaculation.",
    "content": " In the September 2016 issue of the journal Andrologica, a team of researchers published a study that concluded:  [V]itamin B12 concentrations in the blood were significantly lower in patients with PE than the subjects without PE (p &lt; .0001)\u2026. Moreover, the vitamin B12 levels correlated positively with [intravaginal ejaculation latency time] IELT values and correlated negatively with [premature ejaculation diagnostic tool] PEDT scores. This work has also demonstrated that plasma vitamin B12 levels in patients with PE showed an increasing trend with decreasing PE severity.  On October 7, 2016, The Daily Mail inexplicably decided to use this study to advance a pro-Marmite agenda:  [S]ales of Marmite may be in for a boost after scientists discovered it could hold the secret to making men last longer in the bedroom. New research suggests a diet rich in daily helpings of vitamin B12 can combat premature ejaculation, a problem which affects one in four men in the UK. And Marmite is one of the richest sources of the vitamin \u2013 along with meat, fish, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals.  The connection they made sounds \u2014 and may be \u2014 reasonable, but it relies on the untested assumption that increasing B12 would reduce premature ejaculation. Correlation, after all, does not necessarily equal causation, as the authors of the study state:  It is not yet known whether this finding could be translated into a solution for PE; however, vitamin B12 supplementation for the treatment of PE merits further evaluation.  The Daily Mail claim also relies on the assumption that all PE is caused by the same factor, a notion that is not supported by current research:  The pathophysiology of premature ejaculation appears to be multifactorial, implicating the need for multimodal therapeutic regimens to successfully treat premature ejaculation. Multiple treatment regimens have been shown to be effective in extending the time between penetration and ejaculation.  Still, Marmite is fortified with vitamin B12, and it contains 25% of the recommended daily intake of the vitamin. Meat, however, is a much more plentiful source of B12. Because Marmite is completely vegetarian, however, it is a good option for those who do not eat meat. If you want to get your B12 from a source that is not Marmite or meat, have no fear! Many breakfast cereals are fortified with 25% of your daily intake of the vitamin, too. ",

    "claim": "NASA provided $1.1 million in funding to a religious organization to study how humans may react to life beyond Earth. ",
    "content": " NASA made new headlines in late 2021 for an old program that supposedly funded an effort to understand how humans would react to life beyond our home planet. While the hunt for alien life isn\u2019t anything new, the take on the search was: The space agency was said by publications like the New York Post to have hired theologians to \u201cto understand how humans will react to news that intelligent life exists on other planets.\u201d The story picked up speed in late December and was covered by a number of publications. It also made for an interesting gab on social media:  NASA just hired 24 theologians to assess how the world would react if we discovered alien life and I have a feeling this subplot in the season finale of 2021 is planting the seeds for the main storyline of 2022 \u2014 Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) December 26, 2021  And while the claim is largely true, it is based on events that happened years ago. In an email to Snopes, NASA confirmed that it had partially funded research conducted by the nonprofit organization Center for Theological Inquiry (CTI), in Princeton, New Jersey. (The institution is not affiliated with the university as some publications reported.) But the grant ended after two years and the space agency was not involved in the selection of researchers involved in the study, nor were any of the scientists directly employed by NASA       \u201cAddressing the societal implications of astrobiology and, specifically, the potential societal impact of finding life beyond Earth, has been a goal of NASA since 1998,\u201d a spokesperson told Snopes. \u201cThe agency\u2019s Astrobiology program provided partial funding through a grant to the CTI in 2015 to assess societal implications for NASA\u2019s astrobiological and search for life efforts.\u201d NASA further noted that the researchers involved in the study were selected exclusively by CTI. \u201cNASA was not involved in the selection of researchers for this study, and individuals who receive grant funding from NASA are not employees, advisors, or spokespersons for the agency,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cThus, the researchers and scholars involved with this study were not hired by NASA, but instead received funding through CTI to conduct this work.\u201d In an email to Snopes, CTI specified that its research was not a search for aliens, nor did its scientists work for or advise NASA on that topic. Rather, the work focused on \u201cthe scientific study of the potential of the Universe to harbor microbial life beyond Earth.\u201d \u201cThe grant was awarded to enable scholars in the Humanities to become conversant with the current science of astrobiology, and to study its implications for humanity\u2019s views of the natural world in religion and society,\u201d a spokesperson told Snopes. They added that the work is available in the institution\u2019s magazine, Fresh Thinking (Issue No. 1, 2018, pages 32-45; Issue No. 2, 2019, pages 6 to 15). The story originated on Dec. 22, 2021, when the United Kingdom-based newspaper The Times published an interview with a British priest, Reverend Andrew Davidson, who was among 24 theologians to have taken part in the NASA-sponsored program. Davidson was speaking to his upcoming book, \u201cAstrobiology and Christian Doctrine,\u201d set to be published in 2022. A blog stub published by the University of Cambridge further confirmed the work in collaboration with NASA. Davidson, who was a Starbridge Lecturer in Theology and Natural Science at the time of the study, described is project as \u201ceasy to define.\u201d       \u201cI am researching and writing a survey of the main topics in Christian belief \u2014 what is sometimes called \u2018systematic theology\u2019 \u2014 from the perspective of life elsewhere in the universe. I am thinking about its bearing on the doctrines of creation, sin, the person and work of Jesus, redemption, revelation, eschatology, and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cI see my main task as identifying, and working with, parts of the theological tradition that could bear directly upon the topic, even though they have not yet been brought to bear\u2026 So far, my attention has mainly been focused on what theologians call Christology: the discussion of who Jesus was, and in particular of what it would mean to hold that he is both human and divine.\u201d CTI described itself as \u201cconvening theologians and researchers in the humanities and sciences to think together on God and global concerns.\u201d But at the time of the initial funding, the question over whether government funds ought to be allocated to a religious institution, specifically one of Christian orientation, was a controversial one. A letter written by the freedom from Religion Foundation in June 2016 formally requested that NASA rescind the grant, calling it \u201cboth unconstitutional and unnecessary\u201d and an \u201cegregious misuse of secular tax dollars.\u201d Snopes contacted CTI for more information about the findings of the research but did not receive a response as of this writing. We will update the article accordingly. However, an article published by Davidson in 2018 in the journal Theology and Science described his research: Christian theologians have considered the significance of life elsewhere in the cosmos since the fifteenth century, but the brevity of these discussions calls for greater theological precision: the notion of multiple incarnations, for example, is often explored without reference to the detail of Christological formulations. Attention to the logical mode in which such work is set out is also fruitful, where the scholastic category of suitability or fittingness holds particular promise. As suitable, God\u2019s actions are free and yet congruent, being consistent with the divine nature, with creaturely natures, and with the ends of God\u2019s dealings with creatures. Other research posits similar questions, arguing that the study of astrobiology and its intersect with theology present broad consequences, as billions of people around the world subscribe to religious beliefs. Finding extraterrestrial life could exacerbate theological questions surrounding the human origin story, the purpose of life, and could raise concerns that affect how humans conduct themselves, such as begging the question of ethical responsibilities toward life discovered beyond earth.

    "claim": "New research from Arizona State University suggests that a catastrophic super-eruption from the Yellowstone caldera could occur sooner than previously thought.",
    "content": " On 10 October 2017, the New York Times ran a story (with the ominous headline \u201cA Surprise From the Supervolcano Under Yellowstone\u201d) that reported on an August 2017 presentation made by Arizona State University PhD candidate Hannah Shamloo at the 2017 \u201cInternational Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth\u2019s Interior\u201d conference. Christy Till, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Earth and Space Exploration, is the lead researcher of the lab responsible for the work, and was a co-author on the presentation, as well. The Times article discussed their findings, which suggested \u2014 in broad brushstrokes \u2014 that chemical changes that occurred  prior to the past Yellowstone supereruption happened not on a timescale of millennia, as previously believed, but potentially within mere decades. The Times described the crux of the findings this way:  Scientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.  A number of other outlets picked up this story, likely in part because Yellowstone supereruption content is a treasure trove of guaranteed clicks. These stories, as is so often the case, came with increasing levels of inaccuracy, as increasingly sensationalized claims bounced through the Internet echo chamber. By 12 October 2017, the story (as reported by USA Today) had become:  Yellowstone supervolcano may blow sooner than thought \u2014 and could wipe out life on the planet.        To be clear, this is in no way what the researchers at Arizona State University (or anyone else in the field of volcanology) were arguing. First, and most importantly, their research does not in any way, shape, or form, change predictions about the likelihood of a supereruption happening within our lifetimes. That risk remains exceedingly low. Till told us in a telephone interview that her work involves high-resolution chemical sampling of layers in crystals found trapped in rocks (a practice similar to reading past climate information from tree rings). These methods are designed to uncover the nature and timing of chemical changes occurring in magma chambers prior to eruptions. In the case of this specific conference presentation, the topic was the most recent supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera, which occurred 631,000 years ago. Their analysis, achieved by sampling crystals at a resolution of \u201cone-one-hundredth the thickness of a human hair,\u201d suggests that clear and dramatic changes may have occurred in the magma chamber, geologically speaking, shortly before the catastrophic eruption:  Our research is all about the idea that we do see signals in crystals from Yellowstone\u2019s last big eruption 631,000 ago [that could indicate] that there were injections of hotter magma that might have mobilized [cooler magma already in the chamber].  These \u201cinjections\u201d, Till told us, could have occurred just decades before the eruption \u2014 a considerably shorter period of time than some previous ideas about how such processes would work. As such, the research could provide insight into volcanological processes and mechanisms that precede Yellowstone eruptions. This, however, stressed Till, \u201cdoes nothing to suggest that there\u2019s going to be a future eruption.\u201d Further, the chemical signals described in the August presentation are not exclusively indicative of wildly destructive and explosive supereruptions, either. In fact, Till published a paper in 2015 demonstrating similar chemical changes prior to more recent but non-explosive lava flows in Yellowstone.  Ilya Bindeman, a professor of volcanology at the University of Oregon unassociated with the ASU team, echoed this point, telling us via e-mail:  Most eruptions at Yellowstone are lava flows [\u2026], they discharge [a] similar or comparable amount of magma without a super eruption. Since 630,000 years ago there have been many [\u2026] such eruptions. These eruptive products also have \u201cshort\u201d diffusion profiles [similar to the ones from the explosive 630,000 year old event] in their crystals, but they erupted quietly.        While media outlets frequently raise the specter of an apocalyptic supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera, and while the region has indeed produced massive Earth-altering events in the past, scientists remain convinced, based on the size and shape of the current magma chamber, that such an eruption \u2014 were it to happen again \u2014 would likely not occur in our lifetimes. The USGS considers the risk of a caldera-forming apocalypse at Yellowstone in the next couple of thousand years \u201cexceedingly low\u201d. Reassuringly, the Yellowstone region is constantly monitored for potential signs of trouble, as well. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, a collaboration between between the University of Utah, the United States Geological Survey, and the National Park Service, monitors real-time seismic activity, land deformation (from GPS and satellite measurements), and thermal changes or chemical signals from the gases being released (from surface detectors). This kind of predictive work was not the purpose of Till and Shamloo\u2019s research. Their work hopes to uncover a deeper mechanistic understanding of Yellowstone eruptions:  What we\u2019re trying to do is understand that if we do see a signal, what are some other properties that might be causing it to kick in bigger? And what is the timescale associated between that happening in each eruption here? [\u2026] We already have very good scientists who monitor the volcano and would be able to give you [\u2026] months to years warning of an eruption. That\u2019s not changing in any way and there\u2019s no reason that it was going to happen there.  Till, when we asked if media reports of this conference talk were sensationalized, answered with a categorical and immediate \u201cyes.\u201d Because the nature of Till and Shamloo\u2019s work does not intend to assess the probability of a massive supereruption (nor is it capable of doing so), we rank the claim that this new research suggests an increased risk of a humanity-ending death-blast from Yellowstone in our lifetimes as false.

    "content": " Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we\u2019ve learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   During a May 10, 2021, airing of his Fox News show, host Tucker Carlson claimed that National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Anthony Fauci helped provide funding for \u201cgain of function\u201d research at a facility in Wuhan, China, that (supposedly) led to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During that broadcast of \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d Carlson cited an opinion piece regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that was written by Nicolas Wade. In a nutshell, Wade argued without substantiated evidence that gain of function experiments (we\u2019ll explain what those are later) that were prohibited in the U.S. continued at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which ultimately led to the creation of SARS-CoV-2. And because the Wuhan-based institute was not properly regulated, Wade argued, the novel coronavirus was likely to have infected a researcher who would ultimately become the source of the pandemic.            The 13-minute segment began with Carlson criticizing Jeffrey Zeints, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s appointed official to oversee the COVID-19 response efforts. Carlson then suggested that Fauci said Americans can expect to wear masks indefinitely. (We fact-checked that, too. Fauci did not say that.)  \u201cThe question is why is he doing that? Maybe he likes it, that\u2019s possible. But you gotta think at least part of Tony Fauci\u2019s authoritarian germ hysteria is a cover for something else,\u201d Carlson continued. \u201cCould it be that Tony Fauci is trying to divert attention from himself and his own personal role in the COVID-19 pandemic? Now, what do we mean by that?\u201d That\u2019s when Carlson pivoted to \u201cThe origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandora\u2019s box at Wuhan?\u201d \u2014 Wade\u2019s opinion piece \u2014 not a scientific study as was suggested \u2014 published by the nonprofit science organization Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a reputable group that publishes free-access scientific information \u201cconcerning science and global security issues.\u201d Wade is a controversial science writer whose recent theories on race have been generally disputed by researchers around the world. Wade was a former staff writer for the Science Times section of The New York Times up until 2012 and he authored the controversial book, \u201cA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History.\u201d He has been described by researchers at Georgetown University as a \u201csad saga\u201d of a \u201cformer international reporter turned laughing stock.\u201d By and large, Carlson hyperbolized and generalized Wade\u2019s main points in his piece, stretching the key takeaways to suggest that the article \u201cexplains where this virus almost certainly came from.\u201d Carlson furthered that Wade \u201cmakes it clear that more than any other single American, Tony Fauci is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d by laying out a nearly \u201cinsurmountably large amount of evidence\u201d that the virus originated in the WIV. This evidence included conducting experiments \u2014 funded by \u201cAmerican tax dollars\u201d \u2014 to make bat viruses infectious to humans \u201capproved and directed by Tony Fauci,\u201d argued Carlson. We\u2019ll take a closer look at what Wade actually wrote below. As is usual with these sorts of allegations, there is a mixture of half-truths peppered in an alarmist claim meant to incite an emotional response. First, it is important to note that Wade wrote in his opinion piece that of the two theories he believed were plausible, so far neither has \u201cdirect evidence\u201d proving its validity.  \u201cEach depends on a set of reasonable conjectures but so far lacks proof. So I have only clues, not conclusions, to offer. But those clues point in a specific direction. And having inferred that direction, I\u2019m going to delineate some of the strands in this tangled skein of disaster,\u201d he wrote.        After the Carlson video aired, questions surrounding gain of function research were brought to a Senate health committee hearing on May 11 when Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) clashed with Fauci over whether funding from the NIH was used at WIV, suggesting that this might have contributed to the \u201clab leak\u201d hypothesis \u2014 a controversial theory that virus-related experiments accidentally spilled over into the public sphere.     \u201cWe have not funded gain of function research on this virus in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. No matter how many times you say it, it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Fauci.  Wade \u2014 and later Carlson \u2014 also argued that gain of function research funded by the NIH was the likely source of a laboratory leak \u2014 a hypothesis that has been contested by the broader scientific community time and again. Since SARS-CoV-2 was first named in January 2020 and subsequently declared a pandemic, conspiracy theorists have peddled notions that the virus was made in a lab and intentionally released as a biological weapon despite rigorous scientific research proving otherwise.  First and foremost, it is true that WIV was one of many research facilities around the world dedicated to the study of coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses and were at the center of the SARS 2001 and MERS 2012 epidemics, prompting efforts led by the NIH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NIH to better understand their potential for a pandemic.   One form of research conducted at these labs includes the gain of function research. These are experiments to increase the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens to make them more infectious to humans in order to help improve understanding of disease-causing agents and how they interact with humans, as well as their potential to cause a pandemic. In other words, scientists manipulate the genetic code of viruses to change certain elements, making them either more or less dangerous to better understand how they work. But in 2014, the Obama administration called for a \u201cpause\u201d on funding of such experiments, SARS and MERS viruses in particular, and launched a government-led investigation into the risks and benefits of such research.  An ethical analysis white paper written by Professor Michael Selgelid and produced by the NIH Office of Science Policy and published in the journal, Science and Engineering Ethics in 2016 argued that gain of function research poses risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. Using this guidance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed a framework for guiding funding decisions about the gain of function research, and under the recommendation of experts, the NIH lifted its pause.        And it is true that WIV is located miles from where the first COVID-19 outbreak was detected and that the facility previously received funding from the NIH via the EcoHealth Alliance Inc., a research organization based in New York City, as was reported on the agency\u2019s website. But such international cooperation is not unusual, and funding to the lab was also provided through European, Asian, and African organizations as well as the World Health Organization and the European Virus Archive goes global.  To support its work, EcoHealth made subawards to the WIV and other institutions based in East Asia where coronaviruses tend to emerge and are prevalent. A subaward is made when the primary grant recipient (in this case, EcoHealth Alliance Inc.) seeks another organization to carry out part of the grantee\u2019s research project. In this case, NIH said that it did not establish the terms of the award and that EcoHealth was \u201cdirectly accountable for the performance of the project.\u201d In an email to Snopes, EcoHealth Alliance communications manager Robert Kessler said that the organization has neither contributed to nor participated in gain-of-function research. \u201cThe research proposed in the grant application sought to understand how bat coronaviruses evolve naturally in the environment to become transmissible to the human population,\u201d Jennifer Routh, a spokesperson for the NIH, told Snopes. \u201cThis included studying viral diversity in bat reservoirs, surveying people who work in live animal markets or other jobs with high exposure to wildlife for evidence of bat-coronavirus infection, and analyzing data to predict which newly discovered viruses pose the greatest threat to human health.\u201d The application did not propose research to enhance any coronavirus to be more transmissible or virulent, added Routh. The application was subjected to rigorous peer review and was judged to be a high priority, given how SARS-CoV had already emerged in this bat population. To support its work, EcoHealth made sub-awards to WIV and other institutions based in East Asia where coronaviruses tend to emerge and are prevalent. And according to NIH, funds that go to sub-awardees (EcoHealth Alliance) from the primary grantee (NIH) must support the research activities that were approved and funded in the grant, which did not include gain of function research. On May 19, Dr. Francis Collins with the NIH issued the below statement, which the agency forwarded to Snopes: Based on outbreaks of coronaviruses caused by animal to human transmissions such as in Asia in 2003 that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have for many years supported grants to learn more about viruses lurking in bats and other mammals that have the potential to spill over to humans and cause widespread disease. However, neither NIH nor NIAID have ever approved any grant that would have supported \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans. NIH strongly supports the need for further investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO) into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.       The 2014 funding pause pertained to a subset of gain-of-function research that could reasonably be anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route. Following the initiation of the pause, this grant was reviewed again and determined by experts to fall outside the scope of the funding pause. But on Oct. 20, Republicans with the congressional group U.S. House Oversight Committee tweeted a letter written by Lawrence Tabak, principal deputy director of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), confirming that EcoHealth had conducted gain of function research at the WIV. The letter was directed to committee ranking member James Comer, R-Ky.  \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 July 28th NIH says \u201cno NIAID funding was approved for Gain of Function research at the WIV.\u201d Obviously, they were lied to.

In it, Tabak said that \u201cpublished genomic data demonstrate that the bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant to EcoHealth Alliance, INC. and subaward to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) are not and could not have become SARS-CoV-2,\u201d referencing an analysis attached to the letter that was not included in the tweet. (Snopes contacted the DHHS to receive a copy of the letter and the referenced analysis but did not receive a reply at the time of this update. We will include a copy of the report when and if we receive it.) The letter was also said to contain the \u201cfifth and final progress report for Grand R01AI1 10964,\u201d which was awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc. and included data from a research project conducted during the 2018-19 grant period using bat coronavirus genome sequences already existing in nature. The progress report was submitted to the NIH in August 2021 as part of NIH compliance enforcement efforts, and it shows that EcoHealth Alliance violated terms of the grant by failing to report a bat experiment that made mice sicker: The limited experiment described in the final progress report provided by EcoHealth Alliance was testing if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. All other aspects of the mice, including the immune system, remained unchanged. In this limited experiment, laboratory mice were infected with the SHC014 WIV1 bat coronavirus. As sometimes occurs in science, this was an unexpected result of the research as opposed to something that the researchers set out to do. Regardless, the viruses being studied under this grant were genetically very distant from SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses, especially those found in bats, have been studied around the world due to their prevalence in the natural world and ability to infect across species. In fact, there are hundreds of coronaviruses, most of which circulate among animals and some of which can jump to humans in what is called a spillover event. Following the SARS and MERS outbreaks of 2002 and 2012 respectively, the NIAID identified coronaviruses as a priority for researchers to investigate, including how these viruses originate and cause disease, as well as to develop animal study models for new treatments and potential vaccines. SHC014 is a SARS-like coronavirus that infects horseshoe bats that has previously been studied by researchers in mouse models to determine the risk of a SARS-CoV reemergence of infection risk from viruses that naturally circulate in bat populations. During the pandemic, the human ACE2 receptor saw renewed interest by the research community for its role as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In short, the letter by Tabak stated that mice genetically altered to contain the ACE2 receptor were used as testers to determine whether SHC014 would bind to the receptor. And because the laboratory mice became sicker, it is likely that the virus successfully bound. In July 2021, the NIH published a media kit that described its research involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs), which are those that show potential in infecting human populations. Research involving PPPs is required to undergo additional scrutiny when it comes to funding, but at the time of the grant proposal, EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s research did not meet the requirements for further review because it was not shown that these bat coronaviruses could infect humans. However, grant language allowed for a second review \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d pending results to determine whether the research should be reevaluated or new biosafety measures be enacted \u201cEcoHealth failed to report this finding right away, as was required by the terms of the grant,\u201d wrote Tabak. \u201cEcoHealth is being notified that they have five days from today [Oct. 20] to submit to NIH any and all unpublished data from the experiments and work conducted under this review. A joint World Health Organization-China study on the origins of COVID-19 published in March 2019 said that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario and that a lab leak is \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d However, the NIH told Snopes that it \u201cstrongly supports the need for further investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO) into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. \u201cWorking with a cross-regional coalition of 13 countries, we urge the WHO to begin the second phase of their study without delay,\u201d wrote Collins. In short, gain of function research is permitted under certain conditions, and some evidence suggests that such experimentation may have occurred in the past at WIV. At the time of this writing, it appears that experiments to manipulate a coronavirus resulted from research conducted by EcoHealth Alliance during the 2018-19 grant period, but there is not yet conclusive evidence to suggest outright that the virus mutated to SARS-CoV-2, or that it spilled over into the surrounding area. Snopes will update this article once further information into the investigation is provided by EcoHealth Alliance and NIH.
