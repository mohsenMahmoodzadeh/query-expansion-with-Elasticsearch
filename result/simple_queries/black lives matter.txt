    "content": "  Claim:   Photograph shows two people hanging a banner that reads \u201c#BlackLivesMatter: But only when they\u2019re killed by cops. Killed by each other? Not so much.\u201d  FALSE        Example:   [Collected via Twitter, January 2015]    New photo depicts individuals holding up a #BlackLivesMatter banner, powerfully exposing the faults of the movement. pic.twitter.com/4Ebs8Rsr3O \u2014 idea capitalist (@ideacapitalist) January 9, 2015        Origins:   In January 2015, an image purportedly showing a banner associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement bearing the legend \u201cBut only when they\u2019re killed by cops. Killed by each other? Not so much\u201d at the bottom began making its way around the Internet. Although the image prompted a good deal of political comment on the web, it was not a genuine photograph; rather, it was a digital manipulation posted by the web site All the Right Snark on 1 December 2014. The image received a viral push on 7 January 2015 when it was republished by several conservative blogs, including the Conservative Tribune:           If there is a more divisive slogan to have come out of the aftermath of the untimely deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner than \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d I don\u2019t know what it is. It would be so simple to use \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d and at least have the opportunity to unite the entire country behind their cause instead of furthering a racial divide that they claim to denounce. But there are good reasons why the race rioters can\u2019t put \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d on their signs \u2014 they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. Many, many more black lives are taken every year by other blacks than by police officers of any color. The fact that these deaths go without protest is a clear indicator that the demonstrations are not pro-black, but anti-cop. #BlackLivesMatter\u2026 But only when they\u2019re killed by cops. Killed by each other? Not so much.\u201d That pretty much sums it up.      The above-displayed image was altered to add the words \u201cbut only when they\u2019re killed by cops. Killed by each other? Not so much.\u201d The original photograph, which was taken during a vigil held by the Black Law Student Association at Southern Illinois University on 22 October 2014, did not include this message:   To commemorate the event and to identify with others involved in the movement, the students then unrolled a banner from the second floor balcony which read \u201c#Black Lives Matter.\u201d \u201cSome may ask the question, why are we here and why is this cause so important and urgent?\u201d said first-year law student Willie Lyles III. \u201cA friend of mine, Dr. Katrina Gamble, summed it up this way \u2014 \u2018We are fighting for our humanity\u2026 When I think one day my young nephew\u2019s life might be in danger for simply existing in his black skin, the urgency of this fight is undeniable. What is at stake can\u2019t be captured with words. It can only be felt and seen in the eyes of those weary from the heartache and rage that comes with seeing so many black lives taken.'\u201d           Last updated:   9 January 2015   Sources:    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"BLACK LAW STUDENT ASSOCIATION HOSTS 'BLACK LIVES MATTER' DAY OF ACTION VIGIL.\"  &nbsp; &nbsp; Southern Illinois University. &nbsp; 22 October 2014.   --> ",

    "claim": "The streaming music service Pandora endorsed the Black Lives Matter movement while ignoring the deaths of Dallas police officers.",
    "content": " July 2016 saw a week of high-profile shootings involving police the United States: On 5 July 2016, Alton Sterling was shot and killed by police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the following day, Philando Castile was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop in Minnesota; and the day after that a sniper shot and killed five police officers during a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.  On 8 July 2016, the streaming music service Pandora posted a message on social media expressing a feeling of pain and a gesture of support related to those events:  Although Pandora\u2019s post stated that their \u201chearts ache for all of those who unfairly lost their lives\u201d and included the hashtag #LoveAboveAll, their use of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to represent the victims of police shootings but not an equivalent hashtag to represent the policemen killed in Dallas (such as  #BlueLivesMatter) generated controversy along with calls for boycotts of the music service.  That reaction then prompted social media calls for people to subscribe to Pandora as a gesture of support:  @pandora_radio and I'm deleting now \u2014 Big_Blue_Nate123 (@BlueNate123) July 9, 2016        @pandora_radio took a stand, and ppl are pissed\u2026.let's support and subscribe! #LoveAboveAll #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/McvsxAgoAd \u2014 Olivia X (@EsSeNCeofaDiVa) July 11, 2016 Social media messages expressing anger over Pandora\u2019s message often asserted that the Black Lives Matter movement is anti-police, or that the movement was responsible for the shooting of police in Dallas. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza attempted to dispel these rumors during an appearance on All in with Chris Hayes: \u201cBlack Lives Matter has never, ever called for the murder of police officers,\u201d Garza told Hayes. \u201cWhat we have said over and over again is that it is time in this country for policing to be accountable, transparent and responsible. That\u2019s not rhetoric. That is what communities in the United States want to see from the people who protect and serve them. And so quite frankly, we can, at the same time as we grieve the loss of life of several officers who were killed last night, we can also push to demand that there be accountable, responsive, transparent policing that has oversight form communities and that is accountable to the communities they are supposed to protect and serve.\u201d Garza added that Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t concerned with inciting more violence \u2014 in fact, the movement condemns it \u2014 but with tearing down the assumption that black people are criminals. \u201cWe are not anti-police,\u201d she declared. \u201cWe are anti our people being murdered in the streets. What happened to Alton Sterling, what happened to Philando, what happens to so many black people in our communities is absolutely unacceptable, and I think that\u2019s something that we can all agree on.\u201d Ironically, those upset over Pandora\u2019s message announced that they would be boycotting the streaming music service on Facebook, even though Facebook openly expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement by erecting a Black Lives Matter sign outside their headquarters in Menlo Park, California:  ",

    "claim": "The Ford Motor Company donated $100 million to the Black Lives Matter movement.",
    "content": " August 2016 saw the circulation of rumors holding that the Ford Motor Company had donated a large sum of money (typically between one and 100 million dollars) directly to the Black Lives Matter movement: TIME FOR BOYCOTT! Ford Just Gave $100 MILLION To THIS Radical Hate Group Ford used to be one of the most highly-respected and longest-running companies in the United States. Now, the automaker is not only shipping a huge portion of its jobs overseas, it is giving away an enormous sum of money to a separatist and racist hate group. Ford just donated $100 million dollars to Black Lives Matter. A (since removed) blog post published by Allen B. West\u2019s blog on 11 August 2016 called for a boycott of the automaker over the issue: Ford is investing in the Black-Led Movement Fund in partnership with Borealis Philanthropy Movement Strategy Center, and Benedict Consulting. Well, if you were ever looking for a reason not to buy a Ford vehicle or to trade one in you already have, this seems to be just as good as any. Looks like another American icon just caved to the liberal agenda. We see how well that worked out for Target\u2026 Hopefully enough people will express displeasure over this to prompt Ford to stop playing politics and get back to making cars. &lt;!\u2013 However, the claim was resurrected by the unreliable American News on 24 September 2016 (during then-current high-profile Black Lives Matter protests), prompting a new wave of consumers threatening to boycott Ford over Black Lives Matter on Ford Motor Company\u2019s Facebook page:       The claims appeared to stem from an 11 August 2016 article in Fortune, which was admittedly ambiguous in its reporting with respect to the Ford Foundation versus the Ford Motor Company: More than 50 organizations have already registered their support [for the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL)], but one, in particular, stands out. The Ford Foundation added their voice to the growing chorus of supporters, in the strongest possible terms. But the [Ford Foundation] is also planning on studying and underwriting what it calls a \u201cnew and dynamic form of social justice leadership and infrastructure,\u201d by investing in the Black-Led Movement Fund, (BLMF) a pooled donor fund designed to support the work of the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), and led by Borealis Philanthropy. In the first paragraph above, Fortune erroneously linked the word \u201cFord\u201d in \u201cFord Foundation\u201d to the web site of the Ford Motor Company:  \u2013&gt; The origins of the rumor lay with a 19 July 2016 announcement from the Ford Foundation titled \u201cWhy black lives matter to philanthropy\u201d explaining why that foundation had \u201cmade six-year investments in the organizations and networks that compose the Movement for Black Lives\u201d: We are living in anxious, often frightening times. Earlier this month, the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling sparked a new round of public protest against the toxic blend of racism, hypermasculinity, and state violence that has taken the lives of too many black men and women and people of color in the US. At one protest in Dallas, a lone gunman killed five police officers\u2014Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Michael J. Smith, Brent Thompson, and Patrick Zamarripa. We\u2019ve seen reductive attempts to frame the murders in Dallas as a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement, but that obscures the larger democratic principles at play: The officers died while protecting the right to freedom of expression and peaceful protest, and are inexorably linked to Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. These events \u2014 added to so many others, including the fatal shootings of three police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday morning \u2014 have the potential to either deepen empathy and understanding among Americans or divide us even more sharply along lines of race, ethnicity, and gender. That\u2019s why now is the time to stand by and amplify movements rooted in love, compassion, and dignity for all people. Now is the time to call for an end to state violence directed at communities of color. And now is the time to advocate for investment in public services \u2014 including but not limited to police reform \u2014 together with education, health, and employment in communities and for people that have historically had less opportunity and access to all those things.These are the reasons we support the Movement for Black Lives. However, the flaw in claiming that the Ford Motor Company donated millions of dollars to the Black Lives Matter movement is two-fold. First, although the philanthropic Ford Foundation is so named because it was created and originally funded by automobile icon Henry Ford (along with his son Edsel) and because the foundation was a large holder of Ford stock, those associations ended many years ago. No member of the Ford family or Ford Motor Company management sits on the Ford Foundation Board of Trustees, and the Ford Foundation began selling off its Ford Motor Company stock in the mid-1950\u2019s (a process that was completed in 1974). The completely separate Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services is the current philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company. Second, although they may have common goals, the Black Lives Matter movement and the Movement for Black Lives are not the same thing. The latter is not a single group or movement, but rather \u201ca coalition of over 50 black-led organizations\u201d: Black humanity and dignity requires black political will and power. In response to the sustained and increasingly visible violence against Black communities in the U.S. and globally, a collective of more than 50 organizations representing thousands of Black people from across the country have come together with renewed energy and purpose to articulate a common vision and agenda. We are a collective that centers and is rooted in Black communities, but we recognize we have a shared struggle with all oppressed people; collective liberation will be a product of all of our work. Some of the blog posts responsible for the spread of the rumor that the Ford Motor Company had given millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter were later edited to note that the Ford Foundation and Ford Motor Company had long since parted ways, but by then the claim had already been loosed into the wilds of social media, and the important distinction between the two entities was lost as the rumor traveled from blog to blog.

    "claim": "A police horse kicked a Black Lives Matter protester.",
    "content": " On 14 November 2016, various disreputable web sites, including TellMeNow.com and even the evangelical pastor Creflo Dollar, began posting a video of a young blonde woman getting kicked in by a police horse after slapping its rear end, claiming that she was a Black Lives Matter protester who received swift justice: And a Black Lives Matter protester realized how stupid she really is after she slapped a police horse. The horse immediately kicked her in the head. She fell flat on her face and then ran away holding her nose. That\u2019s instant karma! These horses are military grade they are trained for riots and will defend themselves if stupid human beings attack them Think again before touching Gods chosen. According to the Kingston Police Department, the incident happened during a homecoming event for Queens University in Kingston, a city in Ontario, Canada. The incident had nothing to do with the Black Lives Matter movement. We haven\u2019t heard back from Kingston police regarding our inquiries, but a series of tweets sent out by the department on 15 October 2016 about the seemingly raucous day indicated that the horse, a mare called Murney, was new to the department and in the process of being trained. She had been slapped a total of three times during the the homecoming event and was startled, but she had not injured anyone. Police tweeted that the three horse slappers could be charged with injuring a law enforcement animal and receive a maximum of five years in prison:  Police horse, Murney, still in training. Startled by slaps but kept her restraint. 3 accused to be charged with Injury to Animal. pic.twitter.com/S5INhdDunW \u2014 Kingston Police (@kingstonpolice) October 16, 2016       The video was posted to the social media platform Instagram, where it was widely viewed: The incident inspired a satirical post by the Canadian publication The Beaverton, headlined \u201cGritty Kingston Police Horse Transferred to Desk Duty While Internal Affairs Investigates\u201d: \u201cShe was tough as nails,\u201d said her partner Constable Greg McCabe. \u201cAnd had one strong left-hoof and could catch any perp who was on foot or bicycle. What I liked about her was her refusal to use her taser or gun, and just trample. You know, old fashioned police work.\u201d Despite her popularity with her co-workers, her superiors were not impressed with her behaviour. The 8 foot equine was previously investigated for skimming apples from a drug bust in 2012, but the investigation was halted after several witnesses disappeared. Equestrians will tell you it\u2019s never a good idea to sneak up behind a horse: they have a blind spot directly behind them, and they often respond to movement in that area by kicking out with their powerful hind legs. Police horses are methodically trained over time to desensitize them from stimuli that would startle ordinary horses, allowing them to work calmly in high-stress situations. ",

    "claim": "Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors used donations to the movement to buy a $1.4 million mansion.",
    "content": " On April 7, 2021, the real estate gossip website Dirt reported that Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors had purchased a home in Topanga, an eccentric neighborhood located in the western portion of Los Angeles, for $1.4 million. Categorized under real estate purchases by \u201cpoliticians,\u201d Dirt\u2019s headline reported, \u201cBlack Lives Matter Co-Founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors Lands Topanga Canyon Compound.\u201d (Cullors is a political activist, but she isn\u2019t a \u201cpolitician\u201d in the sense that she holds public office.) The story sparked a tsunami of spinoff articles and commentary with the aggregate effect of creating a cloud of doubt over the finances of the nonprofit organization associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, the peak of which was a claim in a meme that baselessly accused Cullors of using donations to Black Lives Matter to purchase the house:  But Dirt\u2019s article, which is the source that all of the stories and posts about the Topanga home purchase are based on, didn\u2019t report that Cullors purchased the home with BLM donations. It said the home was sold \u201cto a corporate entity that public records show is controlled\u201d by Cullors, but didn\u2019t name the corporation.       Cullors is a fairly high-profile public figure. Aside from being an activist and organizer, she makes frequent media appearances. She is the co-author of a best-selling book, \u201cWhen They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir.\u201d She also signed a deal with Warner Brothers in late 2020 to create programming for the network\u2019s various platforms. We sent Dirt an email asking if they would disclose the name of the business entity the home was sold to, but didn\u2019t receive a response in time for publication. We haven\u2019t been able to independently verify Dirt\u2019s report that Cullors purchased the home in Topanga. Her name didn\u2019t come up in our own public records search. In a statement sent to Snopes by email, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) directly denied the allegation: To be abundantly clear, as a registered 501c3, BLMGNF cannot and did not commit any organizational resources toward the purchase of personal property by any employee or volunteer. Any insinuation or assertion to the contrary is categorically false. Since the organization\u2019s inception in 2013, the Foundation said Cullors received compensation totaling $120,000 for work that included serving as spokesperson and engaging in political education. Since 2019, Cullors\u2019 role with the Foundation has been voluntary and unpaid. She currently serves as the executive director, per the Foundation\u2019s statement. The organization also characterized the narrative as a \u201cright-wing offensive\u201d against a high-profile Black activist that \u201cnot only puts Patrisse, her child and her loved ones in harm\u2019s way, it also continues a tradition of terror by white supremacists against Black activists.\u201d We\u2019ll break down some of the dialogue and reporting around this story, but the important points are these: If it\u2019s true that Cullors purchased the Topanga home, no evidence has been presented that proves she did so with donation money. This claim is based on supposition. Important additional context is that while many stories about the home portray it as a lavish purchase, those portrayals are exaggerated.       Is the Home a \u2018Mansion\u2019 That Is \u2018Near Beverly Hills\u2019? Compared with other properties listed on Dirt, the home reportedly purchased by Cullors is relatively modest. Other posts on the site detail multi-million dollar estates bought by the likes of pop music icon Madonna, tennis champion Serena Williams, and pop star Ariana Grande. Even if it\u2019s true that Cullors purchased a single family home in Los Angeles for $1.4 million, we note that because of overall home prices in L.A., that amount doesn\u2019t go as far as it would in other areas. Dirt reports that the home in Topanga has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a guest house and sits on just over a quarter of an acre-sized lot. It\u2019s not small but to call it a \u201cmansion\u201d as Fox News did in an April 13 headline is a stretch. Right-leaning Media Research Center tweeted, \u201cThe liberal media won\u2019t cover this: [Black Lives Matter] co-founder Patrisse Cullors bought a 1.4 MILLION dollar house near Beverly Hills.\u201d Everything in the city of Los Angeles could technically be described as being \u201cnear Beverly Hills\u201d just as easily as it could be described as being \u201cnear Disneyland.\u201d The Topanga community is about 20 miles from Beverly Hills. Did Cullors Go on a \u2018Million-Dollar Real Estate Buying Binge\u2019? Many of the reports touched on tensions among some activists within the Black Lives Matter movement itself by quoting comments given by Hawk Newsome, a BLM activist in New York, who told the New York Post he thought the nonprofit\u2019s finances should be investigated.       Aside from getting record numbers of feet on the street in demonstrations across the country in the spring and summer of 2020, Black Lives Matter organizers told The Associated Press that it brought in $90 million in donations to the nonprofit organization associated with the movement, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. The Post story published on April 10 also reported Cullors went on a \u201cmillion dollar real estate buying binge\u201d and claimed she spent $3.2 million \u201csnagging four high-end homes.\u201d When you read past the headline and leading language, the Post story really describes two modest home purchases, one in South Los Angeles (formerly known as South Central) and the other in Inglewood. Both homes are in working class communities and were purchased for $590,000 and $510,000 respectively. Like most homes in Los Angeles, they have appreciated in value since their most recent purchase date. The Post also reports Cullors\u2019 wife bought a home in rural Georgia and that the couple \u201ceyed\u201d luxury property in the Bahamas, without purchasing it. Was this a \u201cbuying binge\u201d? We don\u2019t have enough information from the Post story to answer questions like: Were these homes consecutively purchased, lived in and sold? Were other parties involved in the reported purchases? Were they lived in by family members? Did any of the addresses crop up due to errors in public records databases? Black Lives Matter and Historical Context Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013 by three women: Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. It was originated as a response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Black teenager Trayvon Martin. But the phrase and its underlying civil rights cause have been the rallying cry for a national racial justice movement in response to the killing of Black people by police, and racism embedded in the criminal justice system. The spring and summer of 2020 saw the movement\u2019s biggest demonstrations in its history, with millions of Americans braving the COVID-19 pandemic to take to the streets, touched off by the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. As the movement reached critical mass and thus scored social and political wins, which included major companies affirming their commitment to racial justice and the election of progressive leaders, Black Lives Matter has also been a regular target for right-wing media and commenters. Cullors resigned from the foundation in May 2021, stating the move had been in the works for more than a year. She told the Associated Press she was resigning to further focus on a new book and the TV deal with Warner Bros. In late August 2021, Cullors was appointed to the Los Angeles County Arts Commission.

    "claim": "A Tennessee principal apologized after backlash to her decision to make \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d the school\u2019s theme for Black History Month in February 2021. ",
    "content": " When thinking of a theme to commemorate Black History Month, a controversial phrase like \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d doesn\u2019t seem a likely fit. Many argue the phrase has been used by opponents of the Black Lives Matter movement to minimize the impact of systemic racism and police violence on the Black community, and one school principal didn\u2019t appear to get the memo. In an email newsletter sent to families on Jan. 31, Christy Caldwell Drake, the principal of East Ridge Middle School (ERMS) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, declared that the theme for February\u2019s Black History Month would be \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d A screenshot of the newsletter was shown on WRCBtv, and stated in bold letters, \u201cERMS Theme \u2013 \u201cALL LIVES MATTER\u201d.\u201d Parents of the students were not happy with the idea, and the principal retracted the theme in another email sent to families a day later. A Google document detailing her apology was posted on the Facebook page of the school\u2019s Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA). Drake wrote: Yesterday, I sent the regular newsletter providing updates to our families as we return to in-person learning this week. As part of that newsletter, I highlighted February as Black History Month with a theme of \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d I want to apologize for not more fully considering the context of that theme, as my inspiration for it was taken from a mural within our school that states \u201cWhere Every Child Matters.\u201d As a black woman in leadership, I embrace civil rights, Black History Month and the sacrifices that have been made by those who came before me. I hope that my students, many of whom look like me, believe in the possibilities of their unlimited potential. My father, Dr. Virgil J. Caldwell, was a local pastor and civil rights leader. I had the opportunity to experience firsthand the fight for equality. Additionally, both of my parents were educators, so I learned at a young age the importance of access to high-quality education. I firmly believe that every child that walks through the doors of East Ridge Middle School matters, and my heart was to emphasize how important each one of our students are to me. The school mural that said \u201cWhere Every Child Matters\u201d was also shared in the original email when Drake announced the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d theme for February.  The school website has a note about \u201cAfrican American History Month\u201d that reads: \u201cVisit the ERMS Library Site to Learn about a new African American Hero and work of Literature each Week of African American History Month!\u201d Given that this controversial theme was acknowledged in the principal\u2019s apology email, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d ",

    "claim": "An old image of truck driver Reginald Denny advocates that drivers not stop for road-blocking protesters.",
    "content": " An image posted to Facebook on 13 August 2016 shows the badly-injured face of Reginald Denny, a truck driver who in 1992 found himself an unwilling participant in history when he was beaten during riots that ensued in Los Angeles after four LAPD officers were acquitted of charges of excessive force stemming from the notorious videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King:  The image shows Denny\u2019s beaten face with the caption: This is Reginald\u2026. Reginald stopped his car for black rioters blocking the road and was attacked for being white\u2026. Don\u2019t be like Reginald\u2026 if \u201cprotesters\u201d are blocking the road hit the GAS not the breaks Aside from encouraging people to commit a felony, the post seems to link violence in Milwaukee in August 2016 over the police shooting of an African-American man with the Los Angeles riots of nearly a quarter of a century ago. While Denny\u2019s beating was caught by news helicopters and broadcast live on television, Milwaukee city officials have told us there were no reported incidents of racially-motivated violence during the unrest in Milwaukee. Furthermore, while Denny was beaten by people who were actively taking part in a riot, modern-day Black Lives Matter protesters typically utilize the tactic of blocking roadways as a form of protest, but without violence. The Los Angeles riots began at the intersection of Florence and Normandie in South Central Los Angeles. Denny was driving his truck through the intersection when he was pulled out and beaten by three men. He was also rescued and taken to the hospital by four African-American L.A. residents who saw him being beaten on live television and came to his aid. ",

    "claim": "Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman authored an essay criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement.",
    "content": " In July 2016, several web sites including Ending The Fed and Political Insider reported that Seattle Seahawks cornerback had authored a message slamming the Black Lives Matter movement: Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman is an NFL star. And he just made it clear, he wants NOTHING to do with the Black Lives Matter movement\u2026 especially their more violent members. King Noble is a controversial leader in the Black Lives Matter movement, and used Sherman\u2019s image in a violent cartoon calling for the killing of white people. Now, we\u2019re learning Sherman allegedly fired back with a FURIOUS response. There is rough language here, and it is definitely not safe for work (NSWF): Although these articles were pubished on 10 July 2016 (not long after five police officers were killed by a sniper at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas) they actually refer to a message posted in September 2015. Ending The Fed did not provide this information, instead misleading readers into thinking that the story was current; they added fuel to the fire by including a screenshot of the rant attributed to Sherman, bearing the timestamp \u201c6 days ago\u201d: I did not believe this when I heard about it. I watched your videos. I started a life in the gehto. I banged like a fool till I woke up. I was not suppressed by any man or woman, white or black. I worked myself up from Compton High School to a scholarship at Standford University and I did it myself. I take pride in what I have accomplished both as a black man, and an athlete. I could have stayed in LA and banged and used drugs and thought that it was all the white mans fault. But that would be a lie. We are who we want to be, that is what is great about america. We are all born with the same chances in life..white or black\u2026YOU choose to be a woman-abusing racist loudmouth. I would love to debate you on national tv. And if you condone senseless black shootings of whites and police officers, you better make that a debate on Springer, so I can bitchslap your ignorant ass! You are what is keeping and making the black race look bad. Wake up fool. Do not glorify this half a man, he has worked for nothing. He chose to keep himself where he is, not the white people. It is time to take responsibility for your own actions, and not act like a stinking fool. Kids and young black men and women look at this site, and believe that they are abused. That is a bold-faced lie. It is out of the mouths of cheap thugs like you that are hurting our young and taking away the chances they have to make themselves a productive part of society. Brothers and sisters: the only slavery in america now is the one you put yourself into Rise up like Doctor King as taught us, and be a real human being. We are all in this together white and black. Peace to all and I hope this stupid fake hate stops real soon. We are all brothers and sisters. Do not be fooled by the tyranny of evil men like this lift yourself up educate yourselves and work hard for a good life [sic]. No one owes you anything stand proud as a person of color , and do something meaningful with your life. I did and I am the best at what I do! Peace out, R Sherman.       Richard Sherman did not author the post displayed above, nor did he write it in response to the shootings of Dallas police officers. The message originally circulated in September 2015, after a meme featuring a photograph of Sherman was included in a blog post purportedly written by radio host King Noble calling for an \u201copen season on killing white people and cops.\u201d At the time, Sherman flatly denied writing the post:   Before reporters could even ask him a question at his weekly press conference, Sherman brought up the issue. \u201cI did not write that article,\u201d said Sherman, who said some people had sent it to him over the weekend. It all started with a blog post purportedly by Atlanta-based activist \u201cKing Noble,\u201d who in a recent video called for an \u201copen season on killing white people and cops.\u201d The blog post purportedly showed a meme of Sherman with his arm around running back Marshawn Lynch with the caption, \u201cWhen we gon Kill These KKKrakas Bro.\u201d That blog post led to the response by someone claiming to be \u201cR Sherman\u201d and included a picture of Sherman as the avatar. Sherman said the impostor\u2019s response was poorly written, but did have some points he agreed with.  At the same press conference, Sherman gave his own thoughts on the Black Lives Matter movement:   \u201cI don\u2019t think any time\u2019s a time to call an all-out war against police or any race of people. I thought that was an ignorant statement but as a black man, I do understand that black lives matter. I stand for that. I believe in that wholeheartedly but I also think there\u2019s a way to go about things and there\u2019s a way to do things.\u201d As yet, no one has claimed authorship of the posting that was originally attributed to Sherman.

    "claim": "A resident of East Texas shared his opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement.",
    "content": " In August 2016 a photograph of an elderly man from the East Texas city of Tyler, along with a quote attributed to him about the Black Lives Matter movement, was posted online. The combination quickly became a viral hit, buoyed by the ongoing discourse around racism and racial tensions in the United States:  \u201cI don\u2019t get all this \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Blue Lives Matter\u2019 divide. I been around here since \u201957 and I never been to jail. All I see now are these young-in\u2019s running around getting shot because they think they can do whatever they want. That\u2019s not how it works, but you can\u2019t tell them that. I know what real racism looks like and I haven\u2019t seen the likes of that ugly face in years. What needs to happen is unity. Respect your fellow man and 99% of the time, they\u2019ll respect you back no matter what you look like. I\u2019m living proof of that.\u201d (Tyler, Texas) The image was first shared to the \u201cPeople of East Texas\u201d Facebook page on 15 August 2016. As with the enormously popular \u201cHumans of New York\u201d Facebook page and web site, \u201cPeople of East Texas\u201d interviews local residents and then shares highlights from those interviews along with photographs: People of East Texas (POET) started on August of 2015. In that short period of time POET and it\u2019s contents has taken on a life of its own. We have been featured in a number of publications and media outlets as well as on countless other social media sites. The goal of POET is to make you, the reader, feel anything but indifferent through organic and raw content provided by those that are interviewed for the page. People of East Texas provided additional information about this particular image in the comments below the post: To clarify, the city of Tyler did not post this. I am an individual. BLM was not brought up in the conversation at all from the interviewer standpoint. The question I asked was, \u201cIf you could give a group of 10,000 people a piece of advice, what would you tell them?\u201d He responded with, \u201cStop fighting\u201d and then I asked him to elaborate in a very non-leading fashion as I normally do. With that being said, If I were to come across anyone that felt very strongly in one direction or the other, I would have no problem posting their comments as they state them. Everyone gets a chance. This just happened to be what he wanted to talk about. ",

    "claim": "A video shows Black Lives Matter protesters in Charlotte attacking and beating a homeless vet.",
    "content": " The 20 September 2016 killing of Keith Lamont Scott by police Charlotte, North Carolina, prompted to several nights of protests in that city, along with rumors that Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrators attacked and beaten a homeless veteran simply because he was white \u2014 with the evidence captured on video:  This video clip was widely circulated online in conjunction with the claim that it depicted events in Charlotte. However, many viewers pointed out the red double decker buses viewable passing by in the background of the clip are not a common feature in Charlotte, and that the clip actually originated in London and had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter protests. That what the video captured took place in London and not Charlotte is documented by a 22 September 2016 British tabloid article that reported on an incident just like the one seen in the video: Sickening footage has emerged of an elderly man being kicked to the ground in what appears to be an unprovoked attack. The incident is believed to have taken place in the Stratford Centre area of London and was published on Twitter. Police have launched an investigation and will be carrying out enquiries around the suspected location in an attempt to identify the victim and suspects. A victim, a man with a white beard and hair, is caught unaware by the vicious attack as he stands at a rubbish bin. As reported, the attack occurred in London and had nothing to do with Charlotte or the Black Lives Matter movement, and the homeless victim (presumably also from London) was not described as a \u201cveteran\u201d or recipient of the Purple Heart award.
