And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In early April 2020, the Trump administration was facing strong criticism for its response to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Against that backdrop, social media users shared posts critical of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leaders of the administration\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 response. The posts accused Fauci of throwing U.S. President Donald Trump under the bus for a belated response to the growing public health crisis, while failing himself to adequately warn the American public of the looming disease threat. Social media posts by Trump\u2019s supporters highlighted an April 12, 2020, interview on CNN in which host Jake Tapper asked Fauci, \u201cDo you think lives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started third week of February, instead of mid-March?\u201d To that question, Fauci gave the answer that earned him the ire of Trump\u2019s supporters: You know, Jake, again, it\u2019s the what would have, what could have. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is \u2014 is complicated. But you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.       In rebuttal to this perceived criticism of the Trump administration, social media users accused Fauci of himself minimizing the threat in a Feb. 29 television interview. One such tweet, bearing the hashtag #FireFauci was retweeted by Trump on April 12, 2020, raising speculation that the president was preparing to fire the doctor.  Another tweet complained that Fauci had said it was \u201csafe\u201d to do things like go to the movies and the gym in early February and March but \u201cdropped Trump in the grease on CNN,\u201d or let the president take the blame. These criticisms ignore the context of Fauci\u2019s Feb. 29 commentary and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 situation. On Feb. 29, Fauci gave an interview on the NBC morning talk show \u201cToday,\u201d during which he stated that at that moment in time, \u201cthe risk is still low, but this could change.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said that many times even on this program,\u201d Fauci stated in that interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d The situation with COVID-19 in the United States was indeed drastically different on Feb. 29 than it was in mid-April.       On Feb. 29, news reports indicated there were 70 known cases in the U.S., and officials were reporting the first known death from the novel coronavirus on American soil. That day also saw the first few reports of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d or transmission of the disease from an unknown source. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that Americans did not need to change their routines for the time being, but he also noted that depending on how the COVID-19 outbreak played out, that could all change, and in the coming weeks, it did. Since that day, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, more than half a million cases have been reported in the United States, and the death toll has rapidly climbed past 20,000 with most of the American public under guidance to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus. Fauci later clarified that in the April 12 interview, he was responding to a \u201chypothetical\u201d question about the administration\u2019s response but noted that his wording choice was \u201cpoor\u201d and that administration officials had in fact heeded his early recommendations about social distancing guidelines. Fauci also noted that his comments in a CNN interview were interpreted by some to mean that the Trump administration gave medical experts \u201cpush back\u201d that cost lives at the beginning of the outbreak. He acknowledged that his answer was not worded well and largely misconstrued. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d ",

    "content": " Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   On April 27, 2021, podcast host, mixed martial arts commentator, and non-doctor Joe Rogan suggest to the millions of people who listen to the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience,\u201d the most popular podcast on Spotify in 2020, that there is no need for young people to concern themselves with the COVID-19 vaccine.  Rogan said: \u201cPeople say, do you think it\u2019s safe to get vaccinated? I\u2019ve said, yeah, I think for the most part it\u2019s safe to get vaccinated. I do. I do \u2026 But if you\u2019re like 21 years old, and you say to me, should I get vaccinated? I\u2019ll go no. Are you healthy? Are you a healthy person? \u2026 If you\u2019re a healthy person, and you\u2019re exercising all the time, and you\u2019re young, and you\u2019re eating well \u2026 like, I don\u2019t think you need to worry about this.\u201d       Rogan said that he thinks it is \u201csafe to get vaccinated,\u201d but he goes on to suggest that young, healthy people have no real reason to get vaccinated. Rogan is wrong.  Here are a few reasons why young, healthy people should still get the COVID-19 vaccine.  1. Young, Healthy People Are Not Immune to COVID-19 Rogan\u2019s claim is based on the inaccurate assumption that COVID-19 only affects the sick and elderly. While it is true that elderly people and those with underlying health conditions have a greater risk of dying or suffering severe symptoms, young people are not immune to COVID-19. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 2,000 people between the ages of 18 and 29 have died from COVID-19.  ABC 7 Chicago reported on such a young, healthy person who died from COVID-19 in October 2020:      2. Young, Healthy People Are Not Immune to COVID-19 Although the chances of death from COVID-19 may be relatively low for young, healthy people, it is not an impossibility. As noted above, young, healthy people with no preexisting conditions have died from this disease. But death is not the only concern.       \u201cLong covid,\u201d a term used to describe the lingering impacts of the disease, can also affect young and healthy people. For example, Mo Bamba and Jayson Tatum, two 22-year-old NBA players who certainly seem to meet Rogan\u2019s definition of \u201cyoung and healthy,\u201d struggled for months to get back into NBA shape after they were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the summer of 2020. As of this writing, both have returned to the league, but Tatum now needs to take an inhaler to \u201copen up my lungs\u201d before games: \u201cIt\u2019s a process. It takes a long time. I take an inhaler before the game since I\u2019ve tested positive. This has kind of helped with that and opened up my lungs, and, you know, I never took an inhaler before. So that\u2019s something different.\u201d These long COVID-19 symptoms can manifest even in people who were not hospitalized after their initial diagnosis.  3. Young, Healthy People Are Not Immune to COVID-19 While the elderly and infirm were at the greatest risk during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, that trend started to shift as the virus mutated in 2021. A more contagious strain of the virus called B.1.1.7 has been found in all 50 states and it has led to an increase in hospitalizations of young people.  New Jersey, for example, saw a 31% jump in COVID-19 hospitalizations in March among young adults ages 20 to 29. Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in a bunch of places now is sick, young people \u2014 hospitalized young people. Whereas earlier on in the pandemic, it was primarily older people \u2026 \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in a bunch of places now is sick, young people \u2014 hospitalized young people. Whereas earlier on in the pandemic, it was primarily older people. The reason for this might be as simple as the older population in this country has either been exposed to this virus, killed by the virus, or now vaccinated against the virus \u2026 The unvaccinated \u2014 those are the people who are getting infected \u2014 we\u2019re seeing a large number of young people, and they\u2019re the ones we\u2019re seeing in hospitals now.\u201d 4. Young, Healthy People Are Not Immune to COVID-19 One of the most confusing aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the idea of asymptomatic transmission. This means that a person may be infected with COVID-19 even though they don\u2019t show any outward symptoms. Although this asymptomatic person will avoid hospitalization (although they could develop long COVID as mentioned above), they can still spread the disease to other people.        In other words, a young, healthy person may not suffer serious symptoms from COVID-19, but they can carry the virus and pass it to someone who might. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to United States President Joe Biden, emphasized this point when he addressed Rogan\u2019s comments:      Fauci said: \u201c(Rogan is) incorrect. And the reason why is that you\u2019re talking about yourself in a vacuum then. You\u2019re worried about yourself getting infected and the likelihood that you\u2019re not going to get any symptoms. But you can get infected and will get infected if you put yourself at risk. And even if you don\u2019t have any symptoms you are propagating the outbreak because it is likely that you, even if you have no symptoms, that you may inadvertently and innocently then infect someone else who might infect someone who really could have a problem with a severe outcome. 5. Young, Healthy People Are Not Immune to COVID-19 On April 29, 2021, Rogan addressed this controversy on his podcast and attempted to clarify a few of his comments. Rogan said that he shouldn\u2019t be considered a respected source of information, and that he doesn\u2019t often think about what he is going to say before he says it during his podcast (which, Rogan admits, is usually recorded while he\u2019s drunk or high). The podcast host also emphasized that he was \u201cnot an anti-vax person\u201d and that there was a lot of \u201clegitimate science\u201d behind these vaccines. Rogan said that he was trying to suggest that young, healthy people had a lower risk of serious complications from COVID-19 (which is generally true but, again, young people are not immune from this disease) but that he agreed with the argument that young people should get vaccinated in order to prevent the disease from spreading to more vulnerable communities, even though he believes that this would be a \u201cseparate conversation.\u201d Here\u2019s a partial transcript of Rogan\u2019s comments. The full video can be seen at the bottom of this article: \u201cThere\u2019s some legitimate science behind [the vaccines]. The thing about this whole thing, people being upset with me, I didn\u2019t say \u2026 I\u2019m not an anti-vax person. In fact, I said I believe that they\u2019re safe and I encourage many people to take them. My parents were vaccinated. I just don\u2019t think that if you\u2019re a young healthy person that you need it. There argument was you need it for other people. [Guest: So you don\u2019t transmit the virus.] That makes more sense. [\u2026] Here\u2019s the thing. These are not like planned statements. Let\u2019s be real clear. When I say something stupid, I\u2019m not thinking about what I\u2019m going to say before I say it. I\u2019m just saying it. I don\u2019t have an off-air and on-air voice. I have me. This is it \u2026 If you say you disagree with me, I probably disagree with me too. I disagree with me all the time. If someone said that young, healthy 21-year-old people who eat well and exercise are not at high risk for coronavirus but you should think about other people, I\u2019d say well that\u2019s a different argument, but yes, that makes sense. But I would say aren\u2019t those people [the vulnerable] vaccinated and shouldn\u2019t we vaccinate the vulnerable? [\u2026] \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m a f*cking moron. I\u2019m a cage fighting commentator who\u2019s a dirty stand up comedian and I just told you I\u2019m drunk most of the time and I do testosterone and I smoke a lot of weed. I\u2019m not a respected source of information even for me\u2026 I at least try to be honest about what I\u2019m saying.\u201d      ",

    "content": " The origins of \u201cYou Worry Me\u201d remain murky: it first  appeared on the Internet in June 2002, but our attempts to verify whether its real author is an American Airlines pilot and/or someone named John Maniscalco have so far led only to dead ends. According to the FAA Registry, John Maniscalco is indeed a real pilot, but this item was also printed in a less vitriolic form in the Hyattsville, Maryland, Gazette (under the title \u201cAn open letter to my Arab-Muslim neighbors\u201d) on 12 October 2001 and credited to a Kevin Daly of Beltsville. Newspaper publication of a piece as a letter to the editor is not a reliable indicator of true authorship, however, as demonstrated by another widely-circulated Internet piece about President Clinton that was printed in several different newspapers under the names of at least four different people. The Gazette letter might have been based on the Internet version, or the Internet version might be an altered transcription of the Gazette letter; John Maniscalco might have been the original author (or alterer), or he might have been someone whose name became attached to the piece simply because he forwarded it to others. Aside from the question of authorship, this is not an item that can be branded \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse,\u201d because it\u2019s merely someone\u2019s expression of his opinions. Thematically, it\u2019s a more overt expression of the feelings conveyed by such (apocryphal) September 11-related legends as the claim that no taxis were to be found around the World Trade Center the morning of the terrorist attacks: the fear and unease generated by the knowledge that the perpetrators were people who had been living among us undetected for months; people who, although they may have been foreigners, were not out of place amidst the cultural diversity of America. How, then, do we now distinguish friend from foe? Wouldn\u2019t it be so much easier if, as advocated in this essay, we could simply assume all ARAB-MUSLIMS to be guilty and demand them to demonstrate otherwise? But such an approach is not only inimical to many of the principles American stands for, it is also logically flawed. What terrorists bent on the destruction of the U.S. would hesitate to camouflage themselves by hypocritically waving American flags or professing a false love for America? We cannot judge people by outward appearances alone, and that realization leaves us feeling scared and powerless.       &nbsp;  Sources:   --> ",

    "claim": "A 1922 New York Times article reported that Adolf Hitler \u201cwas merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers\u201d.",
    "content": " On 10 February 2015, the New York Times re-released the first article they ever published about Adolf Hitler, who was then the chairman of the Nazi party. The story, dated 21 November 1922 and republished in the Times\u2018 \u201cFirst Glimpses\u201d section, opened with this introduction: On Nov. 21, 1922, The New York Times gave its readers their first glimpse of Hitler, in a profile that got a lot of things right \u2014 its description of his ability to work a crowd into a fever pitch, ready then and there to stage a coup, presaged his unsuccessful beer hall putsch less than a year later. But the article also got one crucial point very wrong \u2014 despite what \u201cseveral reliable, well-informed sources\u201d told The Times in the third paragraph from the bottom, his anti-Semitism was every bit as genuine and violent as it sounded. This re-release was widely covered by other news outlets immediately after it was posted in 2015, with many of them suggesting or implying its description bore similarities to the political movement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. An excerpt from that 1922 article reads as follows: But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes. A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\u201d This story was published early in both Hitler\u2019s career and in the existence of the Nazi party itself, whose followers were then called \u2018Hakenkreuzler,\u2019 or \u2018swastika wavers.\u2019 In November 1922, when this article was first published, Hitler had been Nazi party chairman for just over a year, and it had been only three years since he had delivered his first public political speech. Hitler\u2019s failed attempt to overthrow the local government in Bavaria, known as the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch,\u201d was one year away. The Times reached out to Hitler for comment in 1922, which he declined, as described in the story: \u201cHerr Hitler regrets he is unable to meet you as he is leaving town on important business for several days,\u201d was the answer received by The New York Times correspondent. His important business was going to Regensburg with three special trainloads of Munich admirers for the purpose of holding a series of reactionary inflammatory meetings and incidentally to beat up protesting Socialists and Communists with blackjacks if any dare protest, which is becoming increasingly rarer.

    "claim": "A video shows Koko the gorilla spontaneously using sign language to issue a warning about climate change.",
    "content": " If you want an audience to take heed of what you have to say, sometimes the messenger who delivers it for you can be just as important as the message itself. Depending on the nature of your communiqu\u00e9, you may find it has a much greater impact on your intended audience if it is conveyed a a sympathetic figure who can tug at people\u2019s heartstrings (e.g., a child, a Native American, a mother, a veteran) or a respected figure whom viewers perceive as knowledgeable about the subject at hand (e.g., a judge, a policeman, a college professor). A messenger who brought both those qualities to the table was Koko the gorilla, a primate who purportedly understands approximately 2,000 words of the spoken human language and can communicate her thoughts to humans via her use of more than 1,000 signs of what \u2018Gorilla Sign Language\u2019 (a modified version of American Sign Language). In 2015 two non-profit organizations, the Gorilla Foundation (who oversee Koko\u2019s care and training), and NOE Conservation (who seek to safeguard biodiversity), teamed up to produce a Public Service Announcement (PSA) featuring Koko in conjunction with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as the COP21 Climate Conference) held in Paris in December of that year:  That video captured Koko supposedly signing about the importance of our protecting and preserving nature, a message that (given the nature of the proceedings it was associated with) was interpreted as a plea to acknowledge the issue of climate change. The NOE said as much, declaring that the video captured \u201cKoko reacting after she has been informed about what is at stake at COP21.\u201d And the press release issued with the video by the Gorilla Foundation asserted that Koko was indeed being \u201cclear\u201d about wanting to convey the notion that \u201cMan is harming the Earth\u201d: Because of her unique ability to communicate with humans in sign language, Koko is a natural ambassador for endangered species, and thus we agreed to co-produce a short video PSA (Public Service Announcement) contingent on Koko\u2019s willingness to participate. Koko was clear about the main message: Man is harming the Earth and its many animal and plant species and needs to \u201churry\u201d and fix the problem.       We humans may disagree on the possibly deleterious effects our activities are having on our global environment, but how could we possibly ignore a poignant plea from a gorilla \u2014 a message delivered by a personification of Nature itself, who is not coincidentally regarded as sympathetic and knowledgeable regarding the subject at hand? Some viewers took the video a little too literally, however, and were surprised at Koko\u2019s pithy and timely exhortation to heed the perils of global warming. But nothing about the video indicates that Koko can actually entertain, much less communicate to humans, thoughts about environmentalism. For starters, as noted in a 2014 Slate, human-ape communication may be far more about anthropomorphization than actual linguistic expression, especially when it comes to the expressing ideas rather than communicating basic needs: [C]onceding that the scientific jury is still out on whether gorillas are capable of sophisticated emotions doesn\u2019t make headlines, and admitting the ambiguity inherent in interpreting a gorilla\u2019s sign language doesn\u2019t bring in millions of dollars in donations. So we get a story about Koko mourning Robin Williams: a nice, straightforward tale that warms the heart but leaves scientists and skeptics wondering how a gorilla\u2019s emotions can be deduced so easily. Koko is perhaps the most famous product of an ambitious field of research, one that sought from the outset to examine whether apes and humans could communicate. In dozens of studies, scientists raised apes with humans and attempted to teach them language. Dedicated researchers brought apes like Koko into their homes or turned their labs into home-like environments where people and apes could play together and try, often awkwardly, to understand each other. The researchers made these apes the center of their lives. But the research didn\u2019t deliver on its promise. No new studies have been launched in years, and the old ones are fizzling out. A behind-the-scenes look at what remains of this research today reveals a surprisingly dramatic world of lawsuits, mass resignations, and dysfunctional relationships between humans and apes. Unlike us, it seems that apes don\u2019t care to chitchat. Psychologist Susan Goldin-Meadow points out that studies with Kanzi (a bonobo) show that only 4 percent of his signs are commentary, meaning the other 96 percent are all functional signs, asking for food or toys. Similar skepticism about Koko emerged in the 1980s, when Herb Terrace published a fairly scathing critique of ape language research. Among other criticisms, Terrace asserted that Koko\u2019s signs were not spontaneous but instead elicited by [her handler\u2019s] asking her questions. In any case, Koko\u2019s supposed message about climate change and biodiversity is completely lacking in context: the viewer has no idea what any offscreen handlers might have said or done to elicit the signing she produces, or whether the video is anything more than a collection of disjoint, completely unrelated signs strung together into a narrative fashioned by humans rather than a gorilla. Even if we were to assume the (highly unlikely) possibility that Koko\u2019s signing was completely spontaneous and unguided, her \u201cmessage\u201d is highly ambiguous and non-specific \u2014 outside of humans\u2019 suggesting a framework for us to employ in interpreting it: I am gorilla. I am flowers, animals. I am nature. Man Koko love. Earth Koko love. But Man stupid. Stupid! Koko sorry. Koko cry. Time hurry! Fix Earth! Help Earth! Hurry! Protect Earth. Nature see you. Thank you. For all we know, this discourse might have been prompted by Koko\u2019s having just witnessed a clumsy gardener on a power mower carelessly amputating a crop of blooming roses in a nearby flowerbed, and she\u2019s expressing that she wants someone to repair the damage by reattaching the severed buds to their stems. Even the Gorilla Foundation admitted that Koko was \u201cbriefed\u201d on the subject at hand and provided with a \u201cscript\u201d for the video, which was \u201cedited from a number of separate takes\u201d: Turns out Koko was very interested in the subject [of preserving biodiversity], which we briefed her on via a recent issue of National Geographic titled \u201cCool It!\u201d We also presented her with a script drafted by NOE (as any celebrity ambassador asked to do a PSA would expect) and allowed her to improvise during s series of brief daily video discussion sessions, in which Koko also had to learn a few new signs, such as \u201cProtect\u201d and \u201cNature.\u201d The resulting PSA was edited from a number of separate takes, for brevity and continuity.       Barbara King, a biological anthropologist at the College of William and Mary who writes about human evolution, primate behavior, and the cognition and emotion of animals, commented on the the Koko PSA thusly for NPR: [R]eminds me of earlier attempts by the Gorilla Foundation to showcase Koko\u2019s ability to understand things that there\u2019s little chance she could understand, at least in the ways suggested. Anthropomorphism \u2014 the projection of so-called human qualities onto other animals \u2014 is not inevitably wrong. Other animals may share with us many ways of thinking and feeling, and recognizing that fact is often appropriate. But the anthropomorphism in this video is not appropriate. Not even linguistically inclined apes comprehend anything close to the dynamic interplay between humans and nature that underlies anthropogenic climate change. King also quoted Sherman Wilcox, professor of linguistics at the University of New Mexico, as saying in reaction to this video: This is obviously a doctored video composed of highly edited clips of single signs pieced together to make it look like Koko is actually saying something, when she\u2019s not. It is disconcerting on so many levels. I fear it diminishes the seriousness of the climate change issue. Climate change deniers already feel like scientists are lying to the public. We don\u2019t need to give them fake videos. A Huffington Post article on the topic similarly quoted skeptics from the fields of linguistics and primate research: But can a gorilla really grasp abstract concepts like climate change and biodiversity? \u201cOf course not,\u201d Herbert Terrace, director of Columbia University\u2019s Primate Cognition Lab, told The Huffington Post. Terrace criticized the video as \u201chighly misleading\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t know what Koko\u2019s trainer was signing to her before she uttered the various signs \u2026 attributed to her.\u201d Frans de Waal, director of Emory University\u2019s Living Links primate research center, suggested that the conservation video hurts the credibility of those who study animal intelligence. \u201cKoko\u2019s human-coached message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla understands or cares about, such as human global impact,\u201d de Waal told HuffPost. He added that \u201cstunts\u201d like this one \u201chave given the ape-language field a bad name, whereas there is so much more to discover if we just study what cognitively advanced animals can do of their own accord.\u201d \u201cThe problem comes in when we take an ape\u2019s accomplishments and then \u2026 insist \u2026 on putting her forward as a wise old woman, and she\u2019s not,\u201d [Barbara] King said. The Koko climate change PSA is a novel and compelling way of focusing viewer attention on a political message, but it\u2019s basically just a staged commercial, not an expression of sagacity about Nature issued by a non-human creature.

    "claim": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said families that buy electric vehicles (EVs) will \"never have to worry about gas prices again.\"",
    "content": " In November 2021, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg generated controversy by saying that using electric vehicles would allay concerns families have over rising gas prices. One quote of his was picked up by numerous critics, including conservatives, who accused him of being out of touch.  In an interview with MSNBC on Nov. 28, Buttigieg said that families that buy electric vehicles (EVs) \u201cnever have to worry about gas prices again.\u201d \u201cLet them buy cars!\u201d A headline on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s website said in response to the comments, comparing Buttigieg to Marie Antoinette (who, according to legend, said of the starving peasants in France, \u201cLet them eat cake!\u201d). The implication is that the less wealthy Americans who struggle most with high gas prices would not be able to afford electric vehicles.  Other critics argued that Buttigieg\u2019s approach did not, in fact mean families would never have to worry about gas prices again, or that they would end up having to worry about electricity prices instead.   Because electricity is produced out of thin air \ud83e\ude84 pic.twitter.com/IdnVN3kyqJ \u2014 Dr. Eli David (@DrEliDavid) November 29, 2021         P.S. I am totally in favor of electric cars. But the \"never have to worry about gas prices again\" is dumb. The higher the gas prices, the higher the cost of electricity production in most areas. \u2014 Dr. Eli David (@DrEliDavid) November 29, 2021  The Price of Electric Cars But Buttigieg\u2019s comments were in response to a question about whether there were elements of the Build Back Better Act (currently making its way through Congress) that were important to his work as transportation secretary. The act includes incentives in the form of tax credits, he argued, that would make owning an electric vehicle more affordable. Buttigieg said:  [The Build Back Better Act] contains incentives to make it more affordable to buy an electric vehicle, up to a $12,500 discount in effect, for families thinking about getting an EV. Families that once they own that electric vehicle (EV) will never have to worry about gas prices again. The people that stand to benefit the most from owning an EV are often rural residents who have the longest distances to drive, they burn the most gas, and underserved urban residents in areas where there are high gas prices and they are lower income so they would gain the most by having that vehicle. But these are the very residents who have not always been connected to electric vehicles that are viewed as kind of a luxury item. If we can make an electric vehicle less expensive for everybody, more people can take advantage and we\u2019ll be building and selling more American-made EVs which means overtime they will be less expensive to make and to buy for everybody.  What\u2019s the breakdown of the EV incentives that Buttigieg talked about? The bill will give a $7,500 tax credit to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle, with an additional $500 if the vehicle\u2019s battery is made in the US. Another $4,500 tax credit can be added if the vehicle was assembled with domestic union labor.  Policy firm Energy Innovation summarized the incentives as follows: $12,500 max incentive per passenger vehicle, combining: \u2013 $4,000 base for qualified EVs \u2013 $3,500 for vehicles purchased before January 2027 \u2013 $4,500 for vehicles with final assembly in the U.S. at a union facility \u2013 $500 for vehicles manufactured with no less than 50 percent domestic content in component parts and battery cells are manufactured within the U.S. As proposed, the credit may not apply to vehicles over max suggested retail price of $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks or $55,000 for all other vehicles. These provisions are designed to reach more people, including those with low- to moderate-incomes, bolster domestic manufacturing, and support widespread EV adoption.        The same report cited a 2019 University of California Davis study that argued that federal tax credits were one of the most important incentives for owners of moderately-priced EVs, in addition to state rebates, and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access. Part of the incentives policy is not new, the 2019 study noted: \u201cIn all states of the U.S. buyers of [EVs] receive a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 when they purchase an eligible vehicle.\u201d  The American Automobile Association (AAA) also broke the down costs of owning and operation an EV and concluded that \u201cgoing green is not as scary as you think.\u201d They found that owning a new compact EV was \u201conly slightly more expensive \u2013 about $600 annually \u2013 than its gas-powered counterpart.\u201d They said although the overall costs are more, \u201celectric vehicles are lower in individual categories such as fuel and maintenance.\u201d They argued that the cost of electricity used to drive 15,000 miles per year in an EV was $546 on average, while gas costs for the same distance were $1,255 or 130 percent more.  The Price of Electricity  Electricity in the United States is produced mostly through natural gas (around 40%), followed by coal at around 19%. Transportation fuel or gasoline is primarily made from petroleum which generated less than one percent of U.S. electricity in 2020. Therefore, gasoline prices probably wouldn\u2019t directly affect the price of electricity to the extent claimed by some critics. But can rising gasoline prices indirectly affect the cost of natural gas? It is possible, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA): \u201cWhen the prices of competing fuels rise relative to the price of natural gas, switching from those fuels to natural gas may increase natural gas demand and prices.\u201d The EIA also explained the key factors that could affect electricity prices: Fuel prices, especially for natural gas and petroleum fuels (mainly in Hawaii and villages in Alaska), may increase during periods of high electricity demand and when there are fuel supply constraints or disruptions because of extreme weather events and accidental damage to transportation and delivery infrastructure. Higher fuel prices, in turn, may result in higher costs to generate electricity. While Eli David is right to suggest in the tweet above that gas prices may indirectly affect electricity prices in some way, the U.S. is gradually shifting toward renewable sources for electricity, and eventually this argument may become less true over time.  And while it is also possible in the future for EVs to result in a higher demand for electricity, which could cause prices to rise, presently there are not enough EVs being used to affect electricity prices. Currently, the price of nonrenewable fossil fuels including natural gas, coal and oil have risen rapidly in 2021, a situation that those opposing EVs have not accounted for. The New York Times reported that currently the number of EVs used in the U.S. is too small to offset the pain of higher gasoline and natural gas prices.  The Build Back Better Act was passed by the House in mid-November 2021, and, as of this writing, is headed to the Senate.

The image was loosed into the wild, leading many viewers to believe that the rendering was indeed the official logo of the 2016 Iowa State Fair. The claim wasn\u2019t perceived as completely implausible due to Iowa\u2019s popular image as a farming state, so the image of a silo bookended with two bales of hay seemed appropriate in theme. We didn\u2019t find the image in the Iowa State Fair\u2019s media library\u2019s image section, nor did we find any other evidence the event had adopted such a logo. Most official channels for the Iowa State Fair display an image of what appears to be a butter cow against the background of a blue sky:  We contacted the Iowa State Fair\u2019s marketing department for verification, and they confirmed that they were aware of the circulating \u201clogo\u201d but that it did not originate with the Iowa State Fair organization and was not an official or authentic logo.

    "claim": "In July 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump said police officers should \"rough people up more\" and not to worry about injuring suspects during arrests, effectively endorsing use of excessive force by cops.",
    "content": " In May 2020, as many Americans protested the killing of George Floyd \u2014 a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck while Floyd pleaded to breathe \u2014 Twitter users claimed U.S. President Donald Trump helped motivate the officer\u2019s use of excessive force, simultaneously suggesting that the commander-in-chief supported the events that led to Floyd\u2019s death. Among those who claimed the connection between Floyd\u2019s death and Trump\u2019s rhetoric was Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant FBI director for counterintelligence and NBC News analyst, who tweeted on May 26, 2020: \u201cWhen assessing the Minneapolis police misconduct and current culture remember this from 2017: Trump tells cops they should rough people up more during arrests.\u201d His tweet included a link to a Vox story with a headline echoing his claim, a story that highlighted remarks by Trump on July 28, 2017, in front of a crowd of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, police officers, and sheriff\u2019s deputies at a Long Island community college in Suffolk County. Other tweets shared a Washington Post story about the same 2017 Trump event with the headline: \u201cTrump tells police not to worry about injuring suspects during arrests.\u201d   For the purpose of this examination, we\u2019ll focus on what appears to be the crux of the tweets\u2019 claims in May 2020: that Trump about three years earlier encouraged U.S. law enforcement officers to \u201crough people up more\u201d and not to worry about injuring suspects during arrests \u2014 essentially endorsing the use of excessive force by cops no matter the circumstances \u2014 despite local and federal policies that aim to protect civilians\u2019 legal rights and curb police misconduct.       First, we reviewed the source of the claim: Trump\u2019s remarks at the July 2017 event. At some point in the years between the 2017 speech and this report, the White House removed a copy of the speech transcript from the public archives where official addresses by the president are published. CSPAN footage of the July 2017 event, though, shows that the president spent most of his roughly 34-minute address emphasizing his administration\u2019s appreciation for law enforcement, calls to tighten the country\u2019s borders, and intolerance for U.S. gang violence, specifically among members of the Los Angeles-based Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang. Of ICE agents combating such crimes, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re rough. I don\u2019t want to be \u2014 say it because they\u2019ll say that\u2019s not politically correct. You\u2019re not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work.\u201d The crowd responded to that comment and several others by the president with laughter and applause. Then, about 10 minutes later, Trump called on Congress to set aside more federal funding for ICE to dissolve the notorious gang and \u201croot out the criminal cartels from our country,\u201d adding: Now, we\u2019re getting them out anyway, but we\u2019d like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon \u2014 you just see them thrown in, rough \u2014 I said, please don\u2019t be too nice.  (Laughter.) Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you\u2019re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? Like, don\u2019t hit their head and they\u2019ve just killed somebody \u2014 don\u2019t hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, okay? In other words, the president did advise law enforcement officers not to be \u201ctoo nice\u201d with people in custody, without going into specifics on what that means or defining what level of \u201cnice\u201d cops should be while doing their jobs. He also encouraged officers to stop doing one procedure that aims to prevent injuries to civilians: the practice of protecting peoples\u2019 heads when they\u2019re handcuffed and ducking to get into squad cars. Yet it is important to point out a distinction between that comment and the claim: The president did not give officers the green light to injure people no matter the circumstances. Rather, he suggested that authorities should stop specific precautionary measures that could prevent civilians from suffering injuries. It\u2019s the difference between police intentionally shoving someone\u2019s head onto the roof of a squad car or instead guiding them into the vehicle in a way that could cause injury. Additionally, Trump did not explicitly say police should \u201crough people up more\u201d during arrests, even though he did use the word \u201crough\u201d several times in the speech to suggest what he envisions as an ideal law enforcement officer or detainment. After the remark, amid applause and cheers from the crowd, Trump turned around to address the first row of law enforcement officers behind him at the podium \u2014 some of whom were smiling.       The comments were controversial at the time, not just after Floyd\u2019s death in 2020. Civil and human rights activists immediately condemned their interpretation of the president\u2019s remarks and the nonchalant way in which he described a scenario that could result in suspect injuries in police custody. Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement: The President of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence. His remarks undermine the positive efforts of local law enforcement agencies and communities around the country working to address police misconduct and build community-police trust.  That backlash in 2017 also included criticism from U.S. police leaders and organizations that represent them. The chief of the Houston Police Department, for example, tweeted: \u201cTo be clear, inappropriate attempt at gallows humor does not reflect values of respect &amp; commitment to constitutional policing of the profession.\u201d  To conclude our examination, we looked at existing federal statutes and case law that aim to protect the civil rights of all Americans in police custody, no matter what crime police think they committed, and that aim to prevent cops from using \u201cmore force than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim,\u201d as the U.S. Department of Justice says on its website. If Trump had told police to \u201crough people up more\u201d during arrests, like the claim asserts, without explaining under what circumstances he would like that type of excessive force used, he would have essentially been encouraging law-enforcement to break the federal law in cases where force wasn\u2019t \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d In sum, while Trump did say in July 2017 that he would like to see \u201cthugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon\u201d and for officers not to \u201cbe too nice\u201d with people in custody, and while he encouraged police to stop one procedure that aims to prevent injuries to civilians, we rate this claim as \u201cMixture.\u201d He did not explicitly tell police to \u201crough people up more\u201d or to not worry about injuring suspects during arrests, though his comments could be interpreted as support for measures that could result in civilian injuries in police custody.

It is a scene from the 2014 Swedish film Force Majeure, which deals with the aftermath of this man\u2019s decision to abandon his family during a moment of danger. A synopsis of Force Majeure describes \u201cA man\u2019s selfish reaction to the danger posed by an avalanche causes cracks in his marriage and relationships with his children.\u201d Here\u2019s a higher-quality version of the scene:  The avalanche scene can also be glimpsed in the official trailer for Force Majeure:  ",

    "content": " Claim:    Bobby McFerrin, the artist who sang \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy,\u201d killed himself.  FALSE  Example: &nbsp; [Collected on the Internet, 2002]    &nbsp;  --> Origins:   The 1988 feel-good anthem \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy\u201d transformed a talented artist into a household name, garnering Grammy honors as        song of the year and record of the year, and winning the \u201cbest pop vocal, male\u201d award for Bobby McFerrin. It also served to spawn a long-lived rumor: As early as 1992, whispers were afoot that the man who had composed and sung this bouncy little ditty had failed to heed his own advice and had killed himself instead. Usually those rumors were non-specific, baldly imparted as \u201cHe committed suicide,\u201d but sometimes the additional detail that he\u2019d shot himself would be provided. The tale was justly ironic and thus much beloved: the man who\u2019d crooned \u201cIn every life we have some trouble, but when you worry you make it double\u201d ultimately couldn\u2019t stomach what he\u2019d been spooning out to others. Those who\u2019d heard the tune too often during difficult spans in their own lives found a measure of comfort in this, because as anyone who suffers from clinical depression can tell you, getting over it requires far more than the mere adoption of a Pollyanna attitude. Yet the tale wasn\u2019t true. Although he has descended from the musical heights he reached in 1988, Bobby McFerrin is still very much with us  and regularly performs both as a solo artist and as a conductor. The rumor of his suicide fits an established pattern of celebrities who\u2019ve become pop culture icons as much for their benign, cheerful personas as for their accomplishments either dying or furtively concealing odious secrets completely at odds to those smiling visages. In this category we find Steve of Blue\u2019s Clues and Jared Fogel of those interminable Subway commercials, both of whom have supposedly kicked the bucket any number of ways, but also singer John Denver and kiddy show host Mr. Rogers, both of whom are said to have at one time been snipers. We like to look for the dark side and delight in finding it, even to the point of happily seizing upon wholly false rumors about perceived goody two-shoes. However, the false \u201cBobby McFerrin suicide\u201d rumor does indeed have a real-life counterpart. On 10 February 1942, the man who in 1915 wrote the music for \u201cPack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag and Smile, Smile, Smile,\u201d took his own life. Wearing the uniform of the Peacehaven Home Guard, former British Staff Sergeant Felix Powell shot himself in the heart using his own rifle.
