    "claim": "Photographs show a metallic, nonnatural monolith that was discovered in Utah. ",
    "content": " In November 2020, photographs and videos supposedly showing a monolith that was discovered somewhere in Utah started to circulate on social media: While we don\u2019t know too much about what this object is or who put it there, this is a genuine image of a surprising discovery. This photograph was taken by the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau and was posted to their official social media pages on Nov. 20. The bureau explained that they discovered the monolith a few days before while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area.  The Bureau wrote on Instagram: \u201cCounting big horn sheep with DWR this week. During the counts we came across this, in the middle of nowhere, buried deep in the rock. Inquiring minds want to know, what the heck is it? Anyone? \ud83d\udc7d?\u201d In a news release, the organization said that the discovery was made on Nov. 18 somewhere in southeastern Utah. The group did not want to give the exact location of the object, fearing that \u2014 since it was in an isolated area \u2014 it would lead to visitors who could potentially get lost and stranded. The object is made of metal and judging from the photographs it stands over 10 feet tall. While it\u2019s unclear who erected this monolith, the government agency noted that it was illegal \u201cto install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you\u2019re from.\u201d       Here\u2019s the full press release and some additional photographs of the monolith: On November 18, 2020, the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau was working with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to conduct a count of big horn sheep in a portion of southeastern Utah. While on this mission, they spotted an unusual object and landed nearby to investigate further. The crew members found a metal monolith installed in the ground in a remote area of red rock. The crew said there was no obvious indication of who might have put the monolith there. The exact location of the installation is not being disclosed since it is in a very remote area and if individuals were to attempt to visit the area, there is a significant possibility they may become stranded and require rescue. It is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you\u2019re from. The Bureau of Land Management will be determining if they need to investigate further.     While we can\u2019t say for certain where this monolith comes from, the most likely explanation is that it was some form of art installation. It\u2019s possible that it was undertaken in the same spirit as the crop circle hoaxes that popped up around England in the 1970s and convinced a generation of people that aliens were communicating via corn fields. A monolith is defined in the dictionary as a \u201cgreat stone often in the form of an obelisk or column,\u201d but this word has become closely associated with alien encounters, thanks in large part to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d In fact, the monolith that was discovered in Utah bares a resemblance to the alien monolith depicted in the film:      It should also be noted that although news of this mysterious monolith went viral in November 2020, imagery from Google Maps indicates that the odd artifact has been in its current location since at least 2015-16. Here are a few additional videos of this monolith from the Utah Department of Public Safety:          Shortly after these images went viral, it was reported that this mysterious monolith had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d But there was nothing otherworldly about its disappearance. USA Today reported that four humans removed the structure from the area. Monolith mania continued through the end of November as a similar structure was found in Romania.  As of this writing, the most likely explanation for these monoliths continues to be artists/bored humans.  ",

    "content": " In the winter months of 2020, oblong metallic structures appeared and vanished in various locations, creating something of a public mystery \u2014 in part because the objects\u2019 appearance reminded some of the famous monolith in the 1968 science fiction film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d After making a splash and appearing in Utah on Nov. 18, 2020, a monolith appeared in Romania less than two weeks later. Both mysteriously disappeared days after they were found. Then on Dec. 2, a third one was found on Pine Mountain in Atascadero, a city in central California\u2019s coastal San Luis Obispo County.  \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 BREAKING NEWS \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8  There is currently a monolith at the top of Pine Mountain in Atascadero!! (Photos by @Atownreporter) pic.twitter.com/0vPhEWYkeY \u2014 Connor Allen (@ConnorCAllen) December 2, 2020  According to the local newspaper, The Atascadero News, the monolith has become an attraction for hikers in the area: The three-sided obelisk appeared to be made of stainless steel, 10-feet tall and 18 inches wide. The object was welded together at each corner, with rivets attaching the side panels to a likely steel frame inside. The top of the monument did not show any weld marks, and it appears to be hollow at the top, and possibly bottom. Unlike its Utah sibling, the Atascadero obelisk was not attached to the ground, and could be knocked over with a firm push. The Atascadero News estimates it weighs about 200 pounds. As of this writing, there is no publicly-known explanation as to who is responsible for the objects or why they are appearing, although a working hypothesis is that they are part of a guerrilla art installation. Some joked that the monoliths were the work of extraterrestrials. The monolith was torn down overnight by a group of white supremacists decked out in gear labeled with the campaign slogan of U.S. President Donald Trump, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d as reported by Vice on Dec. 3, 2020. One of the men stated on a livestream video of their activity, \u201cChrist is king in this country. We don\u2019t want illegal aliens from Mexico or outer space.\u201d ",

Then I made the drones and balls animation and rendered and imported to After Effects to composite with the real footage.

    "claim": "The remains of a whale were mysteriously found lying in a field in Utah.",
    "content": " On 5 December 2014, the website World News Daily Report published an article reporting that a dairy farmer had found a whale carcass in a field in Farmington, Utah:   A dairy farmer from a small town near the Great Salt Lake in Utah, made an incredible discovery on his property while he was looking for one of his cows that had not returned. 69-year old Michael Woodson, found a 12 meter long humpback whale laying lifeless in the middle of one of his fields, hundreds of kilometers away its natural habitat. The Farmington City Police was called on the site to investigate, since the farmer thought that the cetacean could have been left there as a creepy prank by some neighborhood youngsters. The investigators rapidly dismissed the possibility however, as no traces of vehicles or machinery large enough to carry it were found anywhere near the animal. The police admits that they are almost clueless at the moment as to how the marine mammal found its way on Mr. Woodson\u2019s property. \u201cWe are verifying every clue and information that we have, and I assure you that we will explore every other possibility before we conclude that a UFO has anything to do with the case\u201d added Captain Dawson.  The fictitious story quickly gained traction on social media. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, several people even called local authorities to inquire about the beached (or rather, fielded) whale:  \u201cA Davis County dispatcher confirmed to The Salt Lake Tribune that, no, there was no whale. But they did receive a bunch of calls from people who saw the story.\u201d World News Daily Report is an junk news website that publishes fictional articles. While there was no truth to this particular story, the report did borrow a genuine photograph of a whale carcass lying in a field:  In September 2011, a female Sei whale was found 800 yards from the shore at the Humber estuary at Skeffling, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. While some publications speculated the whale had been dropped off by a UFO, Kirsten Smith, North Seas manager at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, said the whale probably made its way inland during high tide and then got stuck when the waters receded:  \u201cSometimes whales come into shallow water looking for food and get stuck. With the high tide the whale probably got carried up on to the salt marsh, got pushed back further in shore and then got stuck when the tide went out.\u201d  ",

    "claim": "Residents of various U.S. states have received unsolicited mailings of seeds sent from China with malicious intent.",
    "content": " In July 2020, social media users began circulating a warning from the Washington State Department of Agriculture about people in the U.S. receiving unsolicited mailings of seeds sent from China (sometimes in packages identifying the contents as jewelry), which included a caution for recipients not to plant any seeds so received and to report them to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as instances of agricultural smuggling:      Today we received reports of people receiving seeds in the mail from China that they did not order. The seeds are sent in packages usually stating that the contents are jewelry. Unsolicited seeds could be invasive, introduce diseases to local plants, or be harmful to livestock. Here\u2019s what to do if you receive unsolicited seeds from another country:  1) DO NOT plant them and if they are in sealed packaging don\u2019t open the sealed package.  2) This is known as agricultural smuggling. Report it to USDA and maintain the seeds and packaging until USDA instructs you what to do with the packages and seeds. They may be needed as evidence.  This warning corresponded to multiple other governmental alerts and news accounts about persons in the UK and multiple states of the U.S. having received such unsolicited mailings.  The  Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), for example, issued a similar warning to residents of that state:  The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has been notified that several Virginia residents have received unsolicited packages containing seeds that appear to have originated from China. The types of seeds in the packages are unknown at this time and may be invasive plant species. The packages were sent by mail and may have Chinese writing on them. Please do not plant these seeds. VDACS encourages anyone who has received unsolicited seeds in the mail that appears to have Chinese origin to contact the Office of Plant Industry Services (OPIS) at 804.786.3515 or through the ReportAPest@vdacs.virginia.gov email. Invasive species wreak havoc on the environment, displace or destroy native plants and insects and severely damage crops. Taking steps to prevent their introduction is the most effective method of reducing both the risk of invasive species infestations and the cost to control and mitigate those infestations.        Newsweek also reported on residents of Utah receiving the same type of unsolicited packages:  A number of Utah residents have been surprised with a peculiar package in their mailboxes \u2014 a parcel filled with seeds and Chinese writing on the outside. \u201cI opened them up and they were seeds,\u201d said Utah resident Lori Culley, who found her package with Chinese characters, plus a label stating there were earrings inside. \u201cObviously they\u2019re not jewelry!\u201d she said. Culley, who lives in Tooele, thought it may be a case of a mistaken address, but when she posted about it on social media she found \u201cat least 40\u201d local residents had gotten similar packages in the past few weeks. There are regulations as to which plants and seeds can be imported into and sold in Utah. Since the delivery, a representative from the Utah Department of Agriculture picked up Culley\u2019s seeds to have them tested. The department may also get assistance from Customs and Border Protection agents to investigate the mysterious seeds.  Less certain is the purpose behind the mailings.  Explanations from drug smuggling to attempts to trick Americans into planting harmful invasive species have been mooted, although a somewhat different motive has also been suggested: \u201cBetter Business Bureau\u2019s Jane Rupp has another theory. She thinks it could simply be a scam relating to customer reviews, in which companies post low-cost items so they can write fake reviews for their business in a resident\u2019s name.\u201d As U.S. News &amp; World Report explained, the \u201cFake Listing Scam\u201d is employed by disreputable sellers on sites such as Amazon.com, as they attempt to build up false reputations as reliable vendors in order to facilitate luring victims to their scams:  [T]here have been some cases of criminals buying their own products and shipping it to a real address. The con artist then writes a fake review, purportedly from the buyer the product was shipped to. Why does the thief go to the trouble? To make it look like a \u201cverified\u201d review, since the review came from a \u201cbuyer\u201d who bought the product.  \u201cAmazon is continuously developing algorithms to automatically detect these merchants, but it also relies on consumer awareness,\u201d [Kevin Lancaster, CEO of ID Agent] says. And what really can throw people off is that sometimes these con artists build up a couple months of legitimate sales, making a con artist\u2019s products appear reputable, Lancaster says. \u201cPeople buy from the fake listings, and instead of receiving a product in a few weeks, the scammer has already made off with the money,\u201d he explains.  At this juncture it appears true that the mysterious mailings of seeds sent with return addresses in China are real, but the specific motive behind them is as yet unknown. ",

Being raided by FBI. Father and sons charged with abuse of pigs. People were having sex with the piglets???      Origins:   On 2 January 2015, the web site World Daily News Report published an article reporting a supposed FBI raid of a pig brothel in Missouri:  Suspected for sometime by local authorities of running a pig farm functioning as an underground pig brothel, where clients paid for sexual services with the farm animals, the 67-year old farm owner was arrested with two of his sons and some 30 guests who were present to celebrate the New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cWe can\u2019t explain why animal brothels seem to be in high demand in the region\u201d explains psychologist Dane Banff. \u201cThat human beings are allowed to unleash their wildest fantasies in such a context, even though illegal, might prevent such abuses as rape from being committed\u201d she admits. \u201cBut at the same time, having sexual relations with pigs and other animals is not considered to be a healthy behavior and should not be encouraged\u201d she acknowledges. The farmer and his sons could spend up to five years in prison expect legal experts.

    "claim": "The Georgia Guidestones were stolen from their site and then re-erected in New Hampshire. ",
    "content": " In July 2017, NCScooper.com published two stories about the Georgia Guidestones, a mysterious granite monument constructed in the 1980s by an artist under a pseudonym, and inscribed with ten guidelines that are meant to provide humanity with a blueprint for the means to exist on the earth. Whether it is meant to re-establish order after a global apocalypse or is simply something toward which its creators wish humanity to collectively strive is unclear: Engraved in the stones are ten guidelines meant to re-establish the planet and society, perhaps after an apocalypse. They are written in eight different languages, English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese and Russian, and among other commandments preach to: \u2013 Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. \u2013 Rule passion \u2013 faith \u2013 tradition \u2013 and all things with tempered reason. \u2013 Balance personal rights with social duties. \u2013 Be not a cancer on the earth \u2013 Leave room for nature. The guidestones also serve as an astronomical calendar, and every day at noon the sun shines through a narrow hole in the structure and illuminates the day\u2019s date on an engraving. The names of four ancient languages are inscribed on the sides near the top: Babylonian cuneiform, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Additionally an instructional tablet at the site speaks of a time capsule buried underneath the surface, though the dates on which the capsule was buried and when it is to be re-opened are missing. Whether this is intentional or the capsule was never buried is unknown. Naturally, the stones have been the focus of a whole string of conspiracy theories. These articles had little to do with the pre-existing conspiracy theories, however. The first reported that the giant granite slabs had been stolen, and the second article said that they reappeared in New Hampshire: The Georgia Guidestones, which is a mysterious granite monument erected in the early 1980s that contains a set of 10 guidelines in eight modern languages, has been stolen according to Elbert County Sheriff officials. What baffles investigators is how anyone one could have moved the 200 ton slabs without anyone noticing. \u201cSomeone or something came in late last night and took them,\u201d said Elbert County Sheriff Shayne Heap speaking in an early morning press conference. \u201cThose things are really heavy and it would take a large crew and heavy machinery to move them. We also have no motive in the crime, but there always has been a lot of mischief around the Stones.\u201d NCScooper.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories, and these stories are untrue and not meant to be taken seriously. The web site explains in its biting \u201cmanifesto\u201d that its content is satirical in nature and intended to be read as such:  First off, what kind of dolt reads a manifesto? Answer we do and apparently so do you. So congrats. The Scooper is a satirical website is in scope and intent. Sometimes it\u2019s funny; often it is not. in scope and intent. It provides social criticism in a satirical, sometimes news-genre setting. We are not a \u201cfake news\u201d site, but rather an entertainment one. Sometimes it\u2019s just plain-old crappy writing with a few bad jokes. Our intention is not to fool or trick anyone, but obviously it happens. We firmly believe that you can soften a person\u2019s willingness to listen by injecting irony, and yes sometimes humor, into the conversation. The Georgia Guidestones is a real (and unusual) monument that was commissioned by an anonymous group in the 1980s, contains a set of instructions for rebuilding humanity after doomsday that is written in several different languages, and functions as a clock, a calendar, and a compass: Approaching the edifice, it\u2019s hard not to think immediately of England\u2019s Stonehenge or possibly the ominous monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Built in 1980, these pale gray rocks are quietly awaiting the end of the world as we know it. Called the Georgia Guidestones, the monument is a mystery\u2014nobody knows exactly who commissioned it or why. The only clues to its origin are on a nearby plaque on the ground\u2014which gives the dimensions and explains a series of intricate notches and holes that correspond to the movements of the sun and stars\u2014and the \u201cguides\u201d themselves, directives carved into the rocks. These instructions appear in eight languages ranging from English to Swahili and reflect a peculiar New Age ideology. Some are vaguely eugenic (guide reproduction wisely\u2014improving fitness and diversity); others prescribe standard-issue hippie mysticism (prize truth\u2014beauty\u2014love\u2014seeking harmony with the infinite). What\u2019s most widely agreed upon\u2014based on the evidence available\u2014is that the Guidestones are meant to instruct the dazed survivors of some impending apocalypse as they attempt to reconstitute civilization. Although, as mentioned, these odd guidestones are often the subjects of conspiracy theories, the claims that they were stolen and then moved to New Hampshire originated from a satire page. ",

    "claim": "Scientists recently found evidence to explain the mysterious \"Bermuda Triangle\" phenomenon.",
    "content": " The Bermuda Triangle (also known as the Devil\u2019s Triangle) is a mythical section of the Atlantic Ocean (roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico) where numerous ships and airplanes have purportedly disappeared, with many of the vanishings supposedly due to mysterious or undiscovered causes. On Dec. 18, 2020, the Holodilnick website published an article suggesting a scientific explanation had at last been discovered for the Bermuda Triangle enigma, headlined \u201cScientists Find Evidence That May Finally Explain the Bermuda Triangle.\u201d However, readers scanned the Holodilnick article in vain to learn what evidence or explanation had been offered by scientists to explain the mystery, as the text of the report merely made vague reference to \u201cresearchers at the University of Southampton in England\u201d with no elaboration: The Bermuda Triangle has been the subject of intense debate for decades. Over the years, ships and planes have mysteriously disappeared while crossing through the 500,000-square mile area of ocean, and in every instance, no one knows what happened. But those who study the vanishing phenomenon know solid objects don\u2019t just go missing; there has to be some kind of logical explanation for the occurrences. Well, researchers at the University of Southampton in England think they have the answer. The Holodilnick article was apparently an incomplete rehash of news that was already well over two years old. Back in August 2018, multiple news outlets reported on a study by oceanographers from the University of Southampton that posited an oceanographic explication for the so-called \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d phenomenon: British oceanographers from the University of Southampton believe the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle has been busted. After an investigation lasting decades, they\u2019ve concluded that ships are being sucked into the ocean by \u201crogue waves\u201d over 30 metres in height. So what are rogue waves? Basically, they\u2019re abnormally large and unexpected waves in open sea. According to a study on Freak Waves, a standard-issue large wave of around 12 metres will have a breaking pressure of 8.5 psi. Modern ships are designed to tolerate a breaking wave of 21 psi, but a rogue wave can deliver a crushing 140 psi, grossly exceeding the limits of what ships are expected to tolerate. Dr Simon Boxall, an Oceanographer from the University of Southampton who led the new study, explained in the documentary The Bermuda Triangle Enigma: \u201cthere are storms to the South and North, which come together \u2026 we\u2019ve measured waves in excess of 30 metres. The bigger the boat gets, the more damage is done.\u201d \u201cIf you can imagine a rogue waves with peaks at either end, there\u2019s nothing below the boat, so it snaps in two. If it happens, it can sink in two to three minutes,\u201d explained Boxall. Even this information was not exactly new in 2018, as a rogue wave measuring 18.5 metres was first recorded back in 1995. And according to some researchers, there\u2019s really no mystery to the Bermuda Triangle at all; the area just sees proportionally more losses due to the presence of more traffic in that part of the world: Australian Scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki [said] there is no mystery to solve because the incidents were likely caused by human error. \u201cAccording to Lloyds of London and the US coast guard, the number of planes that go missing in the Bermuda Triangle is the same as anywhere in the world on a percentage basis,\u201d Dr Kruszelnicki said. \u201cIt is close to the equator, near a wealthy part of the world, America, therefore you have a lot of traffic.\u201d The Bermuda Triangle is one of the most heavily travelled shipping lanes in the world, with vessels crossing through to get to ports in America, Europe and the Caribbean. The mystery surrounding the area grew in the 20th century with a large number of planes and ships going missing over the decades. ",

    "claim": "Cups and burger wrappers used by the In-N-Out Burger chain are printed with references to Bible verses.",
    "content": " Throughout the years the especially sharp-eyed have noticed the presence of cryptic name-and-number notations on burger wrappings and disposable cups used at In-N-Out Burger, a popular chain of hamburger eateries in California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Oregon, and Utah. These tiny notations are placed in out-of-the-way spots (the undersides of cups and near the seams of the paper pouches burgers are placed in). No overt explanation is given for the presence of the odd phrases or their meaning: they just quietly sit there, awaiting decipherment by those moved to do so.  These mysterious markings are pointers to Biblical passages. Those easily disturbed by the presence of Bible verses need not fear for their souls, however: The text of the passages themselves are not spelled out on the cups and wrappings; only their notations appear there.          In-N-Out Burger was founded by Harry and Esther Snyder in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948. Although this chain of west coast hamburger restaurants has since grown to more than 200 outlets, control still rests in the hands of the Snyder family. According to the company\u2019s web site: \u201cIn-N-Out remains privately owned and the Snyder family has no plans to take the company public or franchise any units.\u201d The Snyders are a religious family, and their continuing to control their own company means they can put what they want on their product packaging. They\u2019ve chosen to include pointers to particular Bible verses that we presume hold special meaning for them. The soda cup bears the notation John 3:16: \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d The milkshake cup lists Proverbs 3:5: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\u201d The water cup (no longer available to customers but we\u2019re told is still used by employees) bears John 14:6: \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d The hamburger and cheeseburger wrappers point to Revelation 3:20: \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\u201d The wrap used for the \u201cDouble-Double\u201d (two burger patties and two slices of cheese) lists Nahum 1:7: \u201cThe Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.\u201d The French fry holder lists Proverbs 24:16: \u201cFor though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity.\u201d We examined the packaging of other menu offerings from In-N-Out (coffee cups, milk containers) but failed to uncover any further pointers to Bible verses. The ones we\u2019ve found expound upon a shared theme: belief in the Lord. As proselytizing goes, this is about as low-key as it gets. Not even the texts of the verses themselves are printed out; those looking to absorb the messages (and who don\u2019t have this article handy) have to do so with the assistance of their own Bibles. Yet even so, the presence of those simple notations has been interpreted by some as indicative of a lurking menace: we\u2019ve had folks tell us they\u2019ve heard In-N-Out Burger was \u201cowned by the religious right\u201d or \u201cthe Christian Coalition,\u201d or a \u201csect,\u201d or that bible-study classes were secretly held at each location. Likewise, the search for a good backstory to enliven whatever appears even slightly mysterious has given birth to a rumor that the presence of the Bible verses is in some way connected to the 1993 death of son Richard Snyder (41) in a plane crash. Though even In-N-Out Burger can\u2019t provide a precise date of when the Bible citations were first placed on its packaging, company records indicate they\u2019ve been there at least since 1987, which rules out the \u201cdeceased son\u201d theory.

    "content": " Claim:   Photographs show a tree in India with a trunk that naturally grows animal-shaped figures.  FALSE  Example:    [Collected via e-mail, June 2008]        A Mysterious Tree in NALGONDA \u2014 Andra Pradesh \u2014 India                             At a glance you may be confused the above tree with a massive trunk with a \u2018Baobab\u2019 tree (which is renowned to possess the largest tree trunks of the world) but, this is yet another unknown specie which is seen in the close proximity of a hermitage deep in the dense forest in \u2018Andra Pradesh\u2019 in India. And most importantly it is natural not artificial.                                    Now have a close look at the bark and experience the unbelievable figures of creatures engraved in the surface of the entire tree trunk!! Absolutely real!!! Not man made                                                                                Origins:   Given how often critics have disdained the Disney theme parks\u2019 recreations of architecture and natural phenomena by describing them with such dismissive terms as \u201cartificial\u201d and \u201cplastic,\u201d Walt himself would probably be amused to see that someone was trying to pass off a completely artificial Disney theme park artifact as a natural phenomenon. The tree pictured above is not found in India, its trunk does not naturally grow figures shaped like animals, and it is not a real life form.  This tree can be found in Orlando, Florida, where it is one of the few artificial trees among the 4 million living plants at the Animal Kingdom theme park in Walt Disney World.  The Tree of Life attraction is the centerpiece of Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom Theme Park, a 14-story, 50-foot wide tree that was \u201csculpted by more than a dozen artisans\u201d and presents a \u201cswirling tapestry of 325 animal carvings that is truly a sight to behold!\u201d Located in the Discovery Island portion of the Animal Kingdom park, the Tree of Life \u2014 one of the most photographed objects in all of Walt Disney World \u2014 was described as follows in a Disney press release:   It is a tree like none other, rising 14 graceful stories into the sky, its leafy canopy spreading 160 feet across the landscape. Its upraised branches beckon: Come take a closer look.  It is impossible to resist a closer look at The Tree of Life, which stands 145 feet tall at the heart of Discovery Island in Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, the newest theme park at Walt Disney World Resort. True, the lofty icon is made by humans. But its story is the awe-inspiring tale of all of Earth\u2019s animals and the interconnected nature of every living thing.  Carved into the tree\u2019s gnarled roots, mighty trunk and sturdy branches is a rich tapestry of more than 300 animals \u2014 from the regal lion to the playful dolphin. Its leaves \u2014 of many colors and four shapes and sizes, all attached by hand to more than 8,000 of the tree\u2019s end branches \u2014 number more than 103,000. Its trunk is 50 feet wide and spreads to 170 feet in diameter at its sprawling root base. Building the tree\u2019s support structure required an engineering plan similar to those used in building offshore oil rigs.  And because it wouldn\u2019t be a tree without being able to sway in the wind, a giant expansion joint encircles the tree at each branch unit.  \u201cThe Tree of Life is a technological marvel, but it\u2019s also  a symbol of the beauty and diversity and the grandeur of our animal life on Earth,\u201d says Joe Rohde, Walt Disney Imagineering vice president and executive designer for the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of our emotions about animals and their habitats.\u201d  Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom guests first encounter The Tree of Life after they stroll through The Oasis, a lush garden setting alive with streams, flowering glades, waterfalls and animals that include iguanas, sloths, macaws and other fascinating creatures. As they continue past the animals and walk through a series of grottoes, guests are treated to their first incredible view of The Tree of Life.  \u201cWe want you to look up at it, to regard it with awe and wonder and to translate those feelings to the real animal world,\u201d Rohde says.  Where The Tree of Life\u2019s giant roots twist over and into the earth, they meld with a quiet landscape of pools, meadows and trees that becomes the natural habitat for flamingoes, otters, lemurs, axis deer, cranes, storks, tortoises and even red kangaroo. Guests can watch from several viewing locations without disturbing the animals as they go about their lives. Invisible barriers exist between animals and guests which appear to be part of the natural terrain.  After guests meander along a pathway through the extensive maze of roots, they discover entry inside the massive trunk to a 430-seat theater. A humorous special-effects experience introduces them to the world of some of our planet\u2019s lesser-known wild creatures \u2014 insects \u2014 from the bug\u2019s point of view. \u201cIt\u2019s Tough to be a Bug!\u201d spins an amusing yarn using 3-D film, Audio-Animatronics\u00ae figures and other in-theater special effects.  While following the pathway that leads to the show, guests can view The Tree of Life from every angle. They see a waterfall rushing from the tree into one of the feeding pools. They spot a dinosaur sculpting formed by the \u201cdead\u201d wood around the tree\u2019s base. They continue to discover sculptings that include an armadillo, an elephant, a camel, a baboon and hundreds of others.  \u201cWe want our visitors to wander up to the tree, to recognize animals and seek out others,\u201d says Zsolt Hormay, Tree of Life chief sculptor and senior production designer. \u201cSome are more recognizable, some are less so. It\u2019s a constant discovery and rediscovery.\u201d  The artistry of the tree, from the carvings to every detail of its composition, required 20 artists led by Hormay, all faced with the challenge of creating a work of art that was at once both natural and fantastic.  \u201cThat was probably the most difficult part of sculpting the tree, to create the 325 animal figures that appear to be formed of bark and wood \u2014 finding the balance between the animal forms and the wood textures was a great challenge,\u201d says Hormay, who hails from Budapest and whose team included three Native American artists, plus artists from France, Ireland, Indianapolis and Central Florida.  In all, it took more than 18 months and a crew of thousands to complete exterior construction of The Tree of Life.  \u201cThis is the most impressive artistic and engineering feat that we have achieved since the original Sleeping Beauty castle at Disneyland,\u201d Rohde says.  To maintain fluidity of the tree\u2019s carvings, the trunk portion was assembled outside the park with 52 rockwork cages from which the animal sculptures were carved. The trunk then was cut into a dozen giant segments and flown to a construction site near the park. There, the segments were joined in pairs. Finally, the completed six trunk segments were transported by crane to the tree\u2019s location, where the final pieces of the trunk puzzle were reunited.
