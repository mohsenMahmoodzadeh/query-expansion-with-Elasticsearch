    "claim": "From an internet advertisement: \"No One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\"",
    "content": " In late 2020, an online advertisement that appeared to be clickbait showed a girl jumping into what looked like a vertical hole in a lake. The photograph of what turned out to be Jacob\u2019s Well included the text: \u201cNo One Realizes How Dangerous This Popular Vacation Spot in California Actually Is.\u201d The image was real, but it had nothing to do with the state of California. Jacob\u2019s Well is a popular destination for swimming in Hays County, Texas. It is the second-largest fully submerged cave in the state. The image of Jacob\u2019s Well had also appeared on Reddit and Pinterest in the past. We were unable to find the name of the photographer.  Internet advertisements that include phrases like \u201cyou won\u2019t believe what happens next\u201d and \u201cdoctors hate him\u201d have dominated the online landscape for years, often failing to deliver on their promises, and leaving readers clicking through endless slideshows with no payoff. The advertisement that claimed \u201cno one realizes how dangerous this popular vacation spot in California actually is\u201d was hosted by Outbrain, and the landing page after clicking the advertisement went to Icepop. Outbrain facilitated the technology that allowed Icepop to run the advertisement. However, Icepop created the content. Icepop\u2019s strategy appeared to be what has become known as advertising arbitrage. We described arbitrage in a previous story that falsely claimed \u201cJeopardy\u201d host Alex Trebek\u2019s net worth \u201cleft his family in tears\u201d following his passing. The basic idea is to make more money by displaying advertisements on each Icepop slideshow page than it had cost to run the Outbrain advertisement that led readers to the slideshow in the first place.       In the case of Jacob\u2019s Well, it appeared on page two of the slideshow, which is quite early compared to other instances of arbitrage. However, the image was quite different than the one that appeared in the advertisement, and since it did not feature California, Icepop\u2019s strategy for the advertisement may have been to keep readers clicking until they found the image from the advertisement. The image from the advertisement did not make an appearance in the slideshow story. The Hays County website described the history of Jacob\u2019s Well, including how it earned the name: Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area consists of five land surveys that all use the spring as a corner to tie the properties together. These surveys were conducted in 1847 by a prominent surveyor names Bartlett Sims. In the early 1850\u2019s William C. Winters, a San Jacinto veteran and early settler of Wimberley, hiked up Cypress Creek searching for its source and found an overflowing spring. It is said that Mr. Winters exclaimed \u201clike unto a well in Bible times.\u201d Thus it was named \u2018Jacob\u2019s Well\u2019. The property changed hands many times over the next 100 years and became a popular recreational destination. Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area remains a popular recreational destination today. The county also noted that the deepest part of the cavern system is 140 feet deep, and that the main cavern length is 4,341 feet. Wimberley Valley Watershed published an informative video on Jacob\u2019s Well Natural Area, which included details on its Native American history. It is true that a handful of people have drowned at Jacob\u2019s Well, but it is false that \u201cno one realizes how dangerous\u201d it is. On top of Jacob\u2019s Well being featured on Reddit and Pinterest, tales of its dangers also appeared in San Antonio Express-News, Discovery, Swimmer\u2019s Daily, All That\u2019s Interesting, and others. On Nov. 26, 1983, an Associated Press story was published in Salisbury, Maryland\u2019s, The Daily Times. It detailed a number of drownings at Jacob\u2019s Well:        In 1984, Wayne W. Russell, Jr. became the ninth fatality at Jacob\u2019s Well. Treehugger linked to a particularly frightening video that purported to show someone freediving around 100 feet (30 meters) into the water without scuba gear.      A Reddit post claimed to show a sign near the entrance to the cave below where swimmers jump into the water.  However, that sign didn\u2019t appear in any diving videos, and may have been shot at Eagle\u2019s Next Sinkhole in Florida, where multiple people have died in the past. The sign also appeared in a YouTube video from a cave dive in Mexico. In sum, Jacob\u2019s Well is a real and dangerous tourist attraction that has led to multiple drownings in the past. However, it\u2019s false to say that it\u2019s located in California, and also not true that \u201cno one\u201d is aware of its dangers. Hays County announced on its parks department phone line that Jacob\u2019s Well would be closed for the remainder of 2020 for \u201caquatic restoration,\u201d and would not reopen for swimming until May 2021. Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages. It\u2019s called advertising \u201carbitrage.\u201d The advertiser\u2019s goal is to make more money on ads displayed on the slideshow\u2019s pages than it cost to show the initial ad that lured them to it. Feel free to submit ads to us, and be sure to include a screenshot of the ad and the link to where the ad leads. ",

    "claim": "McDonald's workers in Denmark make $22 an hour and have six weeks of paid vacation.",
    "content": " On March 2, 2021, as lawmakers in the United States continued to debate a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a message on Twitter noting that McDonald\u2019s workers in Denmark were making $22 an hour and also got six weeks paid vacation: This tweet is largely accurate. McDonald\u2019s workers in Denmark truly make more than $20 an hour and they truly get six weeks of paid vacation. We reached out to 3F, the union that represents fast food workers in Denmark, to get some more information about the wages at McDonald\u2019s. The union representative told us that the pay scheme in Denmark isn\u2019t as simple as saying that all employees make $22 per hour. The majority of McDonald\u2019s workers in Denmark are part-time, and currently receive a base pay of about $20 an hour. Employees earn additional wages for working off-hour shifts (weekends or nights), overtime, and holidays. Employees over the age of 20 also receive a pension plan. The agreement with McDonalds does not only include salary per. hour and 6 weeks holiday. There is extra charge for evening and night work. Payment for seniority, holiday payment (Easter and Christmas for example, (100%), on top of all payment there is an extra 6.85%, Pension plan for employees from the age of 20 (12%). The 3F union rep told us that agreements are renewed every few years. The most recent agreement from 2020 has McDonald\u2019s employees over the age of 18 earning a minimum of DKK 127,24 (about $20.59) per hour, with a slight increase in 2021 (DKK 129,74 or about $21 per hour) and 2022 (DKK 132,24 or $21.40).       As for paid vacations, every working person in Denmark is entitled to five weeks of paid vacation, thanks to the country\u2019s \u201cHoliday Act.\u201d The government of Denmark\u2019s website explains: If you try to visit a Danish office during the last weeks of July, you may find the doors locked entirely. Business largely shuts down at this time of year, as the Danes take time off to enjoy the short Danish summer. Every employee is legally entitled to five weeks\u2019 paid vacation per year, and the Danes are not shy about taking every minute of it. Work-life balance is important in Denmark \u2013 people take pride in their work but do not feel the need to demonstrate their dedication by working long hours. The 3F union rep told us that employees at McDonald\u2019s negotiated for an additional week of paid vacation. In the Danish labor market, all employees have 5 weeks paid holiday by law. Some of the things that are extra in the companies that have a collective agreement, just like McDonalds, is one week more (called Feriefridage). So, the answer to your question is yes. McDonalds employees have 6 weeks\u2019 paid vacation for all. McDonald\u2019s workers in Denmark truly make more than $20 an hour. It\u2019s worth repeating, however, that these wages were not determined by the country\u2019s minimum wage. In fact, Denmark does not have a nationwide minimum wage. Rather, the country has a robust union presence and issues such as wages and vacation time are often decided via collective bargaining. Another point that is often raised when comparing McDonald\u2019s wages in Denmark vs. the United States is how much these wages impact menu prices. While we can\u2019t provide any exact figures here, we can say that the change in price isn\u2019t extreme. A review by The New York Times, for instance, found that Big Macs cost \u201cabout 27 cents more on average in Denmark than in the United States.\u201d But according to the \u201cBig Mac Index\u201d from the Economist, a Big Mac costs 76 cents less in \u201cDenmark (US $4.90) than in the United States (US$5.66) at market exchange rates.\u201d ",

    "claim": "Consumers should be aware of plastic rice from China that is difficult to discern from \"real rice.\"",
    "content": " Since early 2011, social media rumors have asserted plastic rice was being manufactured in China, exported, and consumed by people in other countries unaware the rice they were eating was in fact not a food at all. In February 2011, Raw Story and The Mary Sue published items about the purported plastic rice controversy, both articles noteing that the claims were not substantiated: Various reports in Singapore media have said that Chinese companies are mass producing fake rice made, in part, out of plastic, according to one online publication Very Vietnam \u2026 \u201cA Chinese Restaurant Association official said that eating three bowls of this fake rice would be like eating one plastic bag. Due to the seriousness of the matter, he added that there would be an investigation of factories alleged to be producing the rice,\u201d Very Vietnam noted. The \u201crice\u201d is made by mixing potatoes, sweet potatoes and plastic. The potatoes are first formed into the shape of rice grains. Industrial synthetic resins are then added to the mix. The rice reportedly stays hard even after being cooked \u2026 About 300,000 people were injured and at least six infants died in 2008 when Chinese milk and infant formula was found to be adulterated with melamine, which was thought to help the milk pass nutrition tests. Later that year, melamine was also discovered in Chinese eggs. In what is the most diabolical thing I have read today, a report from Very Vietnam alleges that some Chinese food producers are creating synthetic rice out of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and plastic. The \u201crice\u201d is made by mixing the potato material together, shaping it into grains, and then adding an \u201cindustrial resin\u201d as a binding agent. Very Vietnam says that these resins can be very harmful if eaten \u2026 \u201cA Chinese Restaurant Association official said that eating three bowls of this fake rice would be like eating one plastic bag.\u201d The obvious motivation behind this scheme would be money, since the synthetic \u201crice\u201d is cheaper to produce. This is just another, albeit somewhat more disquieting, in the long line of tainted or defective products apparently coming out of China. These would include the poisonous drywall, and tainted milk. If true, this [is] a cruel, calculated maneuver[.] Between 2011 and 2016 the story intermittently made the social media rounds, losing even the very basic details from unfounded reports that the faux food was purportedly fabricated from other edible starches (such as sweet potato or potato) and distilling it simply to an issue of \u201cplastic rice.\u201d In October 2016, the claim recirculated on Facebook and inspired blog posts anew, such as verbatim details of the years-old claim reproduced on alternative health blogs: Research has shown that certain rice factories in China have been producing a \u201cfake rice substitute\u201d in place of the popular and more expensive Wuchang rice, for greater profit. According to the Korean Times, this food fraud is being created using a mixture of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and synthetic resin (plastic). These ingredients are mixed together and formed into \u201cgrains\u201d which very closely resemble the appearance of actual grains of rice. The rice substitute is then sprayed with a fragrance to mimic the smell of Wuchang rice, making it difficult to decipher between the two versions. As you would expect, consuming this \u201cplastic rice\u201d is extremely harmful and toxic to one\u2019s health, and is causing quite an uproar. One Chinese official warned that eating three bowls of this man-made rice would be equivalent to ingesting one plastic bag.       Perennial plastic rice rumors bear all the hallmarks of a standard \u201cfood from China\u201d panic, including identical claims rehashed year in and out without substantiation. The \u201cChinese Restaurant Official\u201d is always warning that consuming the purported product is akin to eating a plastic bag and asserting that the motive behind the food fakery is cynically financial (without offering any proof that it\u2019s cheaper to go to the trouble of making plastic rice than growing real rice). Another marker of panic over fabricated food from China is the existence of multiple videos purportedly depicting the shady manufacturing of fake rice in factories: At roughly the 1:40 mark, an individual\u2019s hand enters the frame to manually sift the \u201cgrains of rice.\u201d However, the product produced looks way too thick to pass as rice anywhere (commenters surmised the substance shown was actually non-food pellet filling). Language barriers are often effective in advancing such rumors, because unrelated videos can easily be labeled as \u201cproof\u201d of untoward practices when most viewers can\u2019t understand the audio content of the clips. The repurposed video angle was at the forefront of another Chinese export panic involving labor intensive wax cabbage, proffered via a video clip swiped from an Asian television show about making \u201cdisplay food\u201d which is not intended for consumption. And like the plastic rice rumor, the wax cabbage claim circulated bearing the implausible assumption that people would carry on unaware the salad they were eating tasted like a candle, or their rice had a styrofoam-y mouthfeel. The earliest and primary versions of the plastic claim hinged on \u201creports,\u201d alleged investigations, information that was scary \u201cif true,\u201d rice fabrication that \u201cit [was] thought\u201d occurred, and the sort of content which tends to make a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d impression on readers without the need for any rigorous followup. Naturally, the plastic rice claims perpetually played well on social media pages devoted to food sanctimony with or without substantiation. When the claims were new in early 2011, they essentially represented a rumor which had filtered into non-English news sources from an unsubstantiated single report, with no clear evidence presented to suggest plastic rice was real or a known risk. An extant Wikipedia page (littered with clear signs of editorial neglect) lists plastic rice as an \u201cimitation food,\u201d but its citations are largely newer iterations of the old unproven rumor. By May 2015, the plastic rice rumor had hit a fever pitch in Indonesia. One English-language source reported on the initial panic \u2014 and that testing had revealed the claim was false: On May 16, the Harian Terbit newspaper published an article warning that China was producing fake rice. The report urged Indonesians to be vigilant, although it admitted there was no certainty that plastic rice was being circulated in Indonesia. On the same day, MNC Media\u2019s Global TV broadcast the YouTube video and claimed the factory was making fake rice \u2014 despite not having a shred of evidence to prove its allegation. Later, Metro TV aired the same video, claiming it showed a counterfeit rice factory \u2026 All of this \u2018news\u2019 of fake rice filtered through to the community. On May 18, a rice porridge vendor from the West Java city of Bekasi, Dewi Septiani (29), declared she had unwittingly purchased and consumed some plastic rice. She had bought six litres of rice on May 13 from a vendor at Tanah Merah traditional market for Rp.8,000 per litre. She claimed the rice did not turn into proper porridge but instead became congealed, making her, her younger sister and nephew sick after they ate it. Having seen the YouTube clips and the news reports, she assumed they must have consumed synthetic rice. Police questioned the vendor and one of his suppliers and closed his shop. Dewi\u2019s porridge shop was also closed pending investigations. On May 20, samples of the rice \u2014 including some cooked by Dewi \u2014 were taken by police for tests, conducted separately by state-owned certification company Sucofindo, the National Police, the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM), the Trade Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry \u2026 Sucofindo was quick to announce the results of its tests, on May 21 claiming the rice contained traces of polyvinylchloride (PVC), a synthetic compound which is usually used to make pipes. Specifically, it had found traces of three types of plasticizers used in the manufacture of PVC: benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), 2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP). It did not state the percentages of the synthetic materials it had found. Meanwhile, lazy reporters found an old online news article from South Korea from 2011, claiming that rice made out of plastic was being \u201cmassively\u201d sold in China. The report, citing unnamed media sources from Singapore, said \u201cplastic rice is made by forming potatoes and sweet potatoes into rice-like shape, then adding industrial synthetic resins.\u201d It warned that \u201ceating three bowls of plastic rice is the same as eating one vinyl bag\u201d \u2026 These \u2018facts\u2019 quickly made their way into Indonesian and Malaysian media reports. Even before Sucofindo had released its results, the Jakarta division of hip regional city news network Coconuts.co on May 20 proclaimed: \u201cPlastic rice is real, as shown in this video of its production in a Chinese factory.\u201d Oh dear. An accompanying article on http://jakarta.coconuts.co claimed \u201cthis video at least confirms that plastic rice is a real thing\u201d. Utter garbage. On May 26, National Police chief General Badrodin Haiti, after a meeting with the president and other top officials, announced that all of the other tests were negative, so there never had been any plastic rice. He advised the public to stop panicking over the issue \u2026 So why had Sucofindo come up with different results? Badrodin said Sucofindo may have been using different analysis methods or contaminated equipment. BPOM head Roy Sparingga confirmed that his agency had found no synthetic polymers or heavy metals in the rice. He said the World Health Organization\u2019s International Network of Food Safety Authorities had informed BPOM there were no recent cases of synthetic rice in other countries. Trade Minister Rachmat Gobel said his counterparts in China and Malaysia had assured him there was no fake rice in distribution in their countries. In November 2015, the Jakarta Post reiterated that notions of markets rife with synthetic rice were a public panic or \u201choax,\u201d not a legitimate health concern. The same alleged incident with the same porridge vendor was found to have escalated fear of plastic rice, leading to an entrenched belief the staple food was making Indonesians sick: The Jakarta Police have said they have halted an investigation into rice that had been claimed to contain dangerous plastics, as laboratory results had shown the rice samples contained no such materials. Jakarta Police special crime director Sr. Comr. Mujiyono said that based on an examination conducted by the National Police central forensics laboratory (Puslabfor), the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM), and the Agriculture Ministry\u2019\u0080\u0099s research and development unit (Balitbang), the police had concluded that the allegations were erroneous \u2026 In May, state-owned survey company Sucofindo confirmed that rice samples taken from the Bekasi store contained polyvinyl chloride (PVC) usually found in plastic pipes, as well as a plasticizer chemical substance usually found in hydraulic tools and electric capacitors. It announced that the substances could cause kidney, liver, lung problems and cancer if consumed. Nonetheless, the government countered the statement some days later, announcing that a round of official laboratory tests by the BPOM, the Trade Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry had found no plastic substances in the rice samples, which were suspected to have been imported from China. At [a November 2016] press conference, Puslabfor chemistry and biology division representative Sr. Comr Sabran Subandi said that the report also unsettled many other Bekasi residents and the Bekasi police had received many reports regarding artificial rice \u2026 According to him, people had reported their suspicions when they felt sick after consuming the rice \u2026 He said that the police immediately took action on the reports by testing samples of rice in the areas where complaints were made. They did not find any plastic substances in the samples. \u2018\u0080\u009cAs we all know, many people get sick every day. After Dewi\u2019\u0080\u0099s report, cases of sick people seemed to be automatically connected to plastic rice,\u2019\u0080\u009d Sabran said. \u2018\u0080\u009cHowever, they could have been sick for many other reasons.\u2019\u0080\u009d       As of October 2016, the plastic rice panic was still going strong both in and outside the United States. A 17 October 2016 article in The Hindu lamented the routine belief such blatant adulteration was common in spite of food safety regulation processes: Had it not been for the social media, the \u2018Chinese egg\u2019 would not have attained its current notoriety. Similar were the cases of fumes emanating from fish or of plastic rice entering the market or dye being injected into watermelons. Unfortunately, all such reports reached the electronic media and certain sections of the print media, almost confirming people\u2019s fears over instances they saw first on social media. However, why the same social media or the mainstream media did not give much space to reports exposing the hoax remains unclear. The same media which spread the hoax earlier should take the responsibility of clearing the air, believe people with scientific authority and temperament. \u201cOrdinary people are misguided by such videos and news,\u201d says Thomas Biju Mathew, professor and head of the pesticide laboratory of the Kerala Agricultural University. He was involved in a series of tests regarding the \u2018Chinese eggs\u2019 and other issues. \u201cThe social media, instead of complementing our lives, is now almost a disease,\u201d he adds. Dr. Mathew takes a serious view of the fake news spreading through the media and says the government should come up with some cyber law to tackle the problem because it is a crime to create fear and confusion. There are methods to zero in on persons spreading unverified news regarding prominent persons. The methods should be utilised to find the source of fake news as well, he adds. The government has facilities to check any aspect of food adulteration and contamination, and Food Safety offices and inspectors are available in all districts. People should alert Food Safety officials if any such issue occurs in their locality or if they come across a message or news warning of such dangers, says K.V. Shibu, Assistant Commissioner, Food Safety, Ernakulam. Much like soy sauce purportedly made from human hair, the above-mentioned wax lettuce, or warnings about crabs, pork, tilapia, chicken, and garlic exported from China, the plastic rice rumor served as a socially acceptable manner in which people could express reservations about exotic or culturally unpalatable ingredients in Chinese exports (rather than a legitimate health or safety concern). Such legends and rumors antedate their social media format, although before Facebook they tended to manifest in the form of cat and dog meat-stocked freezers or bodily fluids lurking in Chinese takeout, all of which carried the underlying message that Chinese-made goods were not to be trusted. And despite the new life breathed into it by Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms, the base rumor was one of the oldest in circulation. Versions were traced back as far as the 1850s, with one example from 1948 on a snopes.com page explaining why such rumors have tremendous resilience in Western countries: Ancient slur or not, wherever this rumor goes it affects how the locals feel about the Chinese in their midst \u2026 As an example (this rumor has turned up in so many cities, it would be impossible to list them all), in 1995 the closing of two Chinese restaurants in Columbus, Ohio, awakened the sleeping rumor yet again. Calls were fielded, both by the local paper and the board of health, about whispers that these closings were the result of dead cats\u2019 being discovered in each eatery\u2019s meat locker. Never mind that just the previous day the local paper had run a story about the closure (for business reasons) of all 51 restaurants in this particular chain \u2014 the cat meat rumor would not be denied. [The adulterated Chinese food] legend is a classic example of xenophobia (fear and hatred of foreigners or that which is foreign). Asian culture is markedly different from Western culture, with language but the first barrier to be hurdled. Customs, religious observances, traditions \u2014 all are wildly different from their North American counterparts. As with all xenophobic reactions, that which isn\u2019t the same is vilified. The Asian culinary practice of making a tiny bit of meat stretch to feed a family by cutting it up fine and making it part of a larger dish of vegetables or noodles is transformed by fear into a vehicle for \u201cthem\u201d to slip something objectionable into our unwitting stomachs. Likewise, that the Chinese don\u2019t as a rule keep cats and dogs as pets becomes seen as a willingness to plop someone else\u2019s animal companion into the stew pot. Anything for a buck, says this legend, and if in the process one puts over on the white devils, so much the better. Since the appearance of plastic rice rumors in 2011, we have been unable to locate any substantiated reports that anyone successfully passed off plastic rice off as the real thing regularly (or ever) in any of the countries in which the rumor took root. As a case study from Indonesia illustrated thoroughly, the rumor was self-promoting: one woman exposed to the plastic rice rumor became ill and presumed the fake food she\u2019d heard about was to blame. Faulty initial testing cemented the belief, and soon many people were attributing all illnesses to the specter of plastic rice. A few follow-up items reported that thorough testing had revealed the rice in question was not plastic or was simply adulterated, yet the claim went on to make the alternative health rounds in October 2016 unencumbered by the debunkings. All versions stemmed from one shaky item published in January 2011 and plastic rice  lived in realm of legend until 21 December 2016, when the BBC published an article reporting that the notorious faux foodstuff had been \u201cseized in Nigeria.\u201d Although the headline said plastic rice had affirmatively been discovered, the article suggested otherwise: Nigeria has confiscated 2.5 tonnes of \u201cplastic rice\u201d smuggled into the country by unscrupulous businessmen, the customs service says \u2026 Lagos customs chief Haruna Mamudu said the fake rice was intended to be sold in markets during the festive season. The BBC\u2019s Peter Okwoche says it is the only foodstuff that crosses cultural and ethnic lines across the country. Whoever made this fake rice did an exceptionally good job \u2013 on first impression it would have fooled me. When I ran the grains through my fingers nothing felt out of the ordinary \u2026 But when I smelt a handful of the \u201crice\u201d there was a faint chemical odour. Customs officials say when they cooked up the rice it was too sticky \u2013 and it was then abundantly clear this was no ordinary batch. They\u2019ve sent a sample to the laboratories to determine exactly what the \u201crice\u201d is made of. They are also warning the public not to consume the mystery foodstuff as it could be dangerous. Fake food scandals are thankfully rare in Nigeria when you compare it to countries such as China. As of the 21 December 2016 report, the \u201cplastic\u201d rice seized in Nigeria was en route to be tested and its composition unconfirmed. The customs chief\u2019s statement about unsavory businessmen preying on holiday shoppers suggested he was previously aware of the rumor, as did the BBC\u2019s reference to myriad \u201cfake food scandals\u201d in China (which have been almost entirely fictitious, as noted above). It was possible a batch of rice tainted by chemicals or otherwise not fit for consumption was presumed to be the legendary plastic rice by folks exposed to the years-old rumor, or that the rice was in some manner counterfeit. However, the nature of the grains remained in question, and the scenario seemed likely to be an instance of ostension (or pseudo-ostension). On 24 December 2016, Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health announced that tests on the \u201cplastic rice\u201d had revealed the rice was in fact not plastic: In [a] statement, Yetunde Oni, acting director-general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), who briefed minister, was quoted to have said that preliminary findings by the agency failed to validate the claim by the NCS. \u201cFollowing the reports on the seizure of \u2018alleged plastic rice\u2019, NAFDAC team of inspectors led by the Director Ports Inspection Directorate(PID) and Director laboratory services visited the Area Comptroller\u2019s Office, Ikeja, Lagos and drew samples from the seized consignment for laboratory analysis,\u201d Oni said. \u201cThe products were in 25kg pack size with no NAFDAC number, batch details and manufacturing details of address of manufacture and date markings. \u201cThe following preliminary tests and results were found to be in conformity with the specification for rice: Floating\u200a\u2014\u200anegative, cooking\u200a\u2014\u200anormal, odour\u200a\u2014\u200anormal, colour- off-white rice grains , moisture -13.0 , pre-ashing\u200a\u2014\u200anormal.\u201d The plastic rice story (and its fellow counterfeit Chinese food export legends) resemble an internationally viral 2007 CCTV segment about pork buns purportedly made with scrap cardboard, for which an independent journalist was eventually detained and accused of faking the oft-referenced story.

    "claim": "Photograph shows Barack Obama carrying the book The Post-American World, \"a Muslim's view of a defeated America.\"",
    "content": " A photograph of Barack Obama carrying (and presumably reading) the best-selling book, The Post-American World, is a real one, snapped by Doug Mills of the New York Times in Bozeman, Montana, in May 2008:  What does Obama read?Hussein Obama with a book in his hands. He\u2019s reading \u201cThe Post-American World\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a Muslim\u2019s view of a defeated America!  However, the characterization of the pictured book as \u201ca Muslim\u2019s view of a defeated America\u201d is erroneous: The book does not posit a \u201cdefeated America,\u201d nor does it express a Muslim point of view: The The Post-American World was written by Fareed Zakaria, an Indian-born political journalist (commonly described as a \u201cpolitical moderate\u201d) who specializes in world affairs and has written for (and edited) U.S. national news publications, hosted U.S. television news programs, and authored several books on international issues. A Village Voice profile described Zakaria (a naturalized citizen of the United States) thusly: Although he was a rising star in the serious foreign-policy world of the \u201990s (The Nation once described him as a \u201cjunior Kissinger\u201d), it was his post-9/11 Newsweek cover story \u201cWhy They Hate Us\u201d that put him on the mainstream map as someone who could make sense of the now threatening outside world. And he has continued to win himself a substantial following with his thoughtful critiques of the Bush administration\u2019s activities in Iraq. He is America\u2019s go-to man for global chaos, providing some urgently needed outside perspective on our never ending war on terror.His own upbringing was open-minded and secular; he sang Christian hymns at school and celebrated Hindu as well as his own Muslim holidays. \u201cI do know a lot about the world of Islam in an instinctive way that you can\u2019t get through book learning,\u201d he says thoughtfully, but admits he finds the role of token Muslim explainer in the American media slightly uncomfortable. \u201cI occasionally find myself reluctant to be pulled into a world that\u2019s not mine, in the sense that I\u2019m not a religious guy.\u201d       The following review (from Publishers Weekly) summarizes the thesis of The Post-American World The Future of Freedom, Zakaria describes with equal prescience a world in which the United States will no longer dominate the global economy, orchestrate geopolitics, or overwhelm cultures. He sees the \"rise of the rest\" &mdash; the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and many others &mdash; as the great story of our time, and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings, biggest dams, largest-selling movies, and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States. This economic growth is producing political confidence, national pride, and potentially international problems. How should the United States understand and thrive in this rapidly changing international climate? What does it mean to live in a truly global era? Zakaria answers these questions with his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination. &nbsp;  --> When a book proclaims that it is not about the decline of America but the rise of everyone else, readers might expect another diatribe about our dismal post-9/11 world. They are in for a pleasant surprise as Newsweek editor and popular pundit Zakaria (The Future of Freedom) delivers a stimulating, largely optimistic forecast of where the 21st century is heading. We are living in a peaceful era, he maintains; world violence peaked around 1990 and has plummeted to a record low. Burgeoning prosperity has spread to the developing world, raising standards of living in Brazil, India, China andIndonesia. Twenty years ago China discarded Soviet economics but not its politics, leading to a wildly effective, top-down, scorched-earth boom. Its political antithesis, India, also prospers while remaining a chaotic, inefficient democracy, as Indian elected officials are (generally) loathe to use the brutally efficient tactics that are the staple of Chinese governance. Paradoxically, India\u2019s greatest asset is its relative stability in the region; its officials take an unruly population for granted, while dissent produces paranoia in Chinese leaders. Zakaria predicts that despite its record of recent blunders at home and abroad, America will stay strong, buoyed by a stellar educational system and the influx of young immigrants, who give the U.S. a more youthful demographic than Europe and much of Asia whose workers support an increasing population of unproductive elderly. A lucid, thought-provoking appraisal of world affairs, this book will engage readers on both sides of the political spectrum. As for what the chief executive reads in his spare time, according to deputy press secretary Bill Burton, President Obama brought the following books with him to his August 2009 vacation at Martha\u2019s Vineyard:  The Way Home by George Pelecanos, a crime thriller based in Washington, D.C. Lush Life by Richard Price, a story of race and class set in New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Hot, Flat, and Crowded by Tom Friedman, on the benefits to America of an environmental revolution. John Adams by David McCullough, a biography of the Founding Father and 2nd U.S. President. Plainsong by Kent Haruf, a drama about the life of eight different characters living in a Colorado prairie community.  In 2015, President Obama\u2019s summer reading list, as announced by the White House, included the following books:  All That Is, a novel by James Salter, whose \u201cintimately detailed novels and short stories kept a small but devoted audience in his thrall for more than half a century.\u201d All The Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr, the story of a blind French girl and a reluctant German soldier whose lives converge in the French coastal town of Saint Malo. The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert, a work that explores the harmful impact of humans on the planet. The Lowland, by Jhumpa Lahiri, which tells the story of two brothers in Calcutta India in the 1960s who share everything but begin to pull apart as they grow older. Between the World and Me, by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a meditation of race in America in the form of a letter from the author to his adolescent son. Washington: A Life, by Ron Chernow, the historian who penned the biography of Alexander Hamilton that the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d is based on.  ",

    "claim": "A general finds a good comeback when asked about the wisdom of teaching Boy Scouts to shoot.",
    "content": " As apposite as this tale of Boy Scouts and firearms training might be, it\u2019s purely a fabrication and not an excerpt from a real interview. It began circulating on the Internet in 1999 as a quote attributed to an \u201cLTG Reinwald\u201d of the U.S. Army, it reappeared in 2001 attributed to \u201cMarine Corps General Reinwald,\u201d and it came back in 2007 in a version featuring Australian general Peter Cosgrove. When this item initially appeared in 1999, the U.S. Army denied that there was a Lieutenant General Reinwald among their ranks and chalked the whole thing up as a hoax. (Which is as logic dictated all along: if an armed forces spokesperson gave voice to a sexist remark likening a female interviewer to a prostitute in a public interview, that officer would soon be called upon to make a very public apology as well as face charges within ranks for conduct unbecoming.) National Public Radio had this to say about the matter: We are aware of an erroneous story posted on the Free Republic Website, and possibly elsewhere, which mentions a supposed interview between an unnamed NPR reporter and a U.S. Army Lieutenant General Reinwald. The story is false \u2014 the dialogue mentioned was not an NPR interview, and it never aired on any NPR program. Those who support gun rights and believe responsible gun ownership begins with teaching young people the right way to handle firearms at an early age have a great fondness for this story. As well they should, because this anecdote illustrates in a humorous way the difference between having the ability to do something and allowing that ability to dictate one\u2019s life choices.       The \u201cGeneral Reinwald\u201d story existed in joke form as far back as October 1997, when it appeared on a number of web pages in the following form:  Excerpt from a recent live radio interview on one of the regional Welsh stations: A female newscaster is interviewing the leader of a Youth club: Interviewer: So, Mr. Jones, what are you going to do with these children on this adventure holiday? Mr Jones: We\u2019re going to teach them climbing, abseiling, canoeing, archery, shooting \u2026 Interviewer: Shooting! That\u2019s a bit irresponsible isn\u2019t it? Jones: I don\u2019t see why, they\u2019ll be properly supervised on the range. Interviewer: Don\u2019t you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children? Jones: I don\u2019t see how, we will be teaching them proper range discipline before they even touch a firearm. Interviewer: But you\u2019re equipping them to become violent killers. Jones: Well, you\u2019re equipped to be a prostitute but you\u2019re not one are you? Needless to say, the interview was terminated almost immediately. Notice the differences that have taken place between the two tellings:  \u201cAbseiling\u201d has been taken out of the Americanized version (probably because whoever altered the text didn\u2019t know it was a rock climbing term meaning rappelling down rock faces). A Welsh youth club leader called simply Mr. Jones has been transformed into a named Lieutenant General in the U.S. army. Welsh children (presumably boys and girls) have become American Boy Scouts. A regional Welsh radio station has become the National Public Radio in the United States.  If there\u2019s still any doubt someone took a joke set in Wales and changed details to Americanize it, look to the Reinwald version given in the example. Although the term \u201cadventure holiday\u201d is common in Britain, it\u2019s an unlikely term for an American general to use. (Looks like whoever altered the text missed that one.) No anecdote is so good that it cannot be improved upon, and that appears to be what happened here. To give the story its proper \u201coomph,\u201d having the telling remark issue from a mere youth club leader wouldn\u2019t do. But make the man with the snappy comeback a Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army, and the story becomes ever so much more tellable. The key element of the Reinwald legend has appeared in other tales. Observe the form it took in this gender-switched version collected in 2000, which was presented as a joke and not as an event that actually happened: A couple went on vacation to a fishing resort up north. The husband liked to fish at the crack of dawn. The wife liked to read. One morning the husband returned after several hours of fishing and decided to take a short nap. Although she wasn\u2019t familiar with the lake, the wife decided to take the boat out. She rowed out a short distance, anchored, and returned to reading her book. Along came the sheriff in his boat. He pulled up alongside her and said, \u201cGood morning, Ma\u2019am. What are you doing?\u201d \u201cReading my book\u201d she replies as she thinks to herself, \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re in a restricted fishing area,\u201d he informed her. \u201cBut officer, I\u2019m not fishing. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d \u201cYes, but you have all the equipment. I\u2019ll have to take you in and write you up.\u201d \u201cIf you do that, I\u2019ll have to charge you with rape,\u201d snapped the irate woman. \u201cBut, I haven\u2019t even touched you,\u201d groused the sheriff. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut you do have all the equipment.\u201d MORAL: Never argue with a woman who knows how to read. Variations: &nbsp; In 2007 the version of this anecdote in circulation replaced the fictitious U.S. Lieutenant General Reinwald with the real General Peter Cosgrove of Australia and shifted the interview source from National Public Radio (NPR) to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).   &nbsp; &nbsp; Cummings, Jeanne. &nbsp; \"Gingrich Out to Save America.\"  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. &nbsp; 16 January 1994 &nbsp; (p.

But is he truly passed away and we are honoring our blessed being by carrying out the presents?           Origins:    A common form of visual humor is creating images  that juxtapose opposites: good and bad, innocence and sexuality, peacefulness and violence,  benevolence and depravity.  Images associated with children particularly lend themselves to this form of humor, so we often see, for example, illustrations that portray Disney characters engaged in sexual activity or place cuddly cartoon characters such as Care Bears or Smurfs into scenes of violence and carnage. In this vein, Santa Claus comes in for annual drubbings \u2014 as an ageless, immortal, benevolent, and perpetually jolly figure who lives for nothing more than to spread good cheer and deliver toys to deserving children, poor Santa ends up in all sorts of shock humor tableaux that associate him with unhappiness, death, and gore.  One such image is displayed above, which supposedly shows a child bawling upon encountering a grave with a headstone indicating that Santa Claus had died earlier in the year and was interred there.  Of course, it\u2019s a composite image that uses a stock photograph of a crying child also found in other advertisements:  Although this case was a manufactured image, in recent years we\u2019ve seen a number of other instances of people seemingly extending Halloween all the way through to the Christmas season by using traditional holiday decorations to create some rather gruesome scenarios outside their residences.  This year (2005), for example, a Miami Beach man chose to express his dismay with the commercialization of Christmas by blindfolding a Santa Claus figure, binding its hands and feet with wire, then placing a noose around its neck and hanging it high up in a tree in his yard.  Neighborhood residents angered by the display of a lynched Santa Claus contacted local police demanding that it be taken down, but the police had no legal grounds for requiring the property owner to remove it (although news reports indicated the display had been taken down by mid-December):        And another man who claimed he was making a point about the commercialization of Christmas created an even more horrific display when he placed a blood-spattered, knife-wielding Santa Claus figure holding a bloody severed head outside his Manhattan brownstone (and capped off the spectacle by \u201cdecorating\u201d a tree with the heads of Barbie dolls):  And finally, an Orlando, Florida resident put together a somewhat more imaginative (if no less ghastly) exhibit by using Christmas lights to represent a gutted Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer figure hanging from a tree:   Last updated:   21 December 2005              Sources:       Vanden Brook, Tom.    \u201cThe Spirit of Halloween at Christmas.\u201d      USA Today.   16 December 2005.

    "content": " Claim:   Truckers are poised to strike over rising fuel prices.  MIXTURE OF TRUE AND FALSE INFORMATION  Examples:         [Collected via e-mail, August 2005] Good Morning Friends, I have spoken with a few independent truckers in the past 24 hours, and they ALL have indicated to me that there will be a nationwide trucker strike by the Teamsters Union &amp; Major Independents commencing between 8 &amp; 12 September 2005. They will be protesting the high price of fuel nationwide, and intend to bring the Nation to her knees, as they did in the early seventies. I have no reason to doubt these individuals, as their grapevine is usually accurate, and this poses a serious problem for the Nation at large. Almost everything moves by truck across this country, and it won\u2019t take very long for our merchants shelves and gasoline storage tanks to empty resulting in serious shortages in food and fuel. So, be prepared\u2026. fill your pantries and autos prior to the eighth of September!!!! Unlike the contrived oil and gasoline shortages of the early seventies, the US is not in the position of turning open the spigot and allowing the oil and refined products to flow. Because of the hurricane, the lack of new refineries, and the lack of an ingenious national energy policy, these shortages are real and will be exploited by the Teamsters Union. Every domestic refinery is producing gasoline and home heating oil at maximum capabilities, and combined with the shut down of the refineries in the Gulf due to the hurricane, along with the inability to pump crude oil from the Gulf region, there will be serious shortages for approximately two months. This is a serious National emergency!!!! There have already been long gasoline lines in the South this Labor Day weekend, as many with whom I have spoken from that region have stated to me that in some areas of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, gasoline is already being rationed. These individuals are being allowed only 10 gallons each\u2026. just enough to get by during this shortage. Every Governor of the above mentioned states have asked their citizens to stay at home over the holiday, thus trying to avoid a disaster in the making. Wal-Mart has announced that their entire fleet of trucks will stop moving good and services effective Tuesday, September 6th\u2026 they know that something is in the making, and don\u2019t want to jeopardize either their trucks or personnel during the National Strike. Every independent trucker with whom I have spoken, has stated to me that they will not roll during this time frame, as the Teamsters mean business!!!! Terry\u2026\u2026Teamster Union Member     [Collected via e-mail, August 2005] Are you aware American\u2019s are considered greedy? \u2013 Saudi Arabia 2005 target price for selling oil was $21 a barrel. Currently, they\u2019re selling oil at almost $70 a barrel, while their cost of producing that barrel is just $1.50 . . . (Fortune, Financial Times, New York Mercantile, Exchange) Consider this E-mail a WARNING\u2026Truckers unions losing patience with the Federal Government and the U.S. Oil Companies\u2026 truckers are advised to watch for signs of terrorist activity (AP). . .Under pressure, major freight carriers strike early agreements with Teamsters Union . . . 88,000 unionized truckers are getting the brunt of fuel costs, the major Truckers Unions and drivers has had about enough of getting ripped off.  With truckers unions and drivers claiming unreal fuel expenses the unrest and shift is beginning to give birth to a National Truckers Strike. There have been some severe strikes in years past and the talk is complete shut down.  Even the owner operators will park their rigs and go out and even work at menial jobs just to survive. The cost of operation has been eating away their truck payments.  One comment was said at a local, \u201cI wonder if the banks have big enough parking lots to hold the repossessions\u201d . . . The anger has begun to intensify with drivers and the Truckers Union which is directed towards Federal and Oil Companies.  August 17th 2005 a small nucleus of Tanker and Trailer drivers begun to organize in Alabama. It is said three Unions have started to react with the drivers and are threatening to strike for lower fuel prices or else.  It has elevated to a fever to contact and encourage their counterparts in other States throughout the nation to strike, Nationwide. If this threat begins to take form, there are preparations that MUST be started NOW.  The trucking industry is the prime provider for pretty much everything we have and enjoy in our home. One major item happens to be our FOOD, then our Fuel, medical supplies, clothing, housewares, building materials, emergency supplies when disaster happens, it goes on and on and on. Get the point, this fuel expense is beginning to take its toll. It is vitally serious and important for you to increase your immediate food supply, purchase can food items, canned meat, (most of these canned items have a shelf life of 5 Years.)  NOW is time to STOCK UP and not when the trucks stop rolling. THIS IS A WARNING IN ADVANCE.  Inform your friends and families include the elderly. You are asked to send this to anyone and everyone. This threat is real, do nothing now and you will find out.     [Collected via e-mail, March 2008] I drive a delivery truck, and stopped at a truck stop off of I \u2013 95. There was a group of truckers standing around talking, and I happened to hear them talking about the upcoming strike planned for the first of April. It is in response to the unaffordable diesel prices, and our government\u2019s lack of help to the independent businessman. I was told by them that I should try and stay off of I-95 and to stock up on food stuffs because its gonna get really expensive, really quick. Has any one else heard of this? I have noticed that the local grocers I deliver to have doubled their on hand supply of foodstock, and have noticed that prices have started to really go up quite a bit, really quickly. This might be one heck of a great april fools joke, but what if it isn\u2019t?      Origins:   Various e-mails about a looming independent truckers and Teamsters union strike began arriving in inboxes everywhere in the last week of August 2005.  However, at that time there was no mention of an impending nationwide labor action on the Teamsters web  site, nor was there an announcement from Wal-Mart that its fleet of trucks would suspend operations on Tuesday, September 6th (as claimed in e-mailed warnings). And, in the event, no such truckers\u2019 strike ever did materialize. In March 2008, rumors once again began to circulate that truckers would stage a strike on 1 April 2008 (not as a mandatory union-sponsored work stoppage, but as a grassroots demonstration supported by independent truck owner-operators) to protest the rising price of diesel fuel. Until a few years ago diesel fuel had generally been cheaper than gasoline, but emissions standards requiring the use of ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) have driven up diesel prices to the point that it is now often more expensive than gasoline.  (As of mid-March 2008, the average price of diesel fuel in the U.S. was $4.037 per gallon, while gasoline prices averaged $3.275 per gallon during that period.) Every 5-cent increase in the price of diesel results in an estimated $1,000 increase in truckers\u2019 annual expenses, and in March 2008 independent truckers began talking about staging a one-day nationwide trucker shutdown on 1 April 2008 to protest the prospect of their \u201cgoing broke out on the highway wearing our trucks out\u201d:         A trucker\u2019s strike may be looming on the horizon.  Many independent over the road truck drivers are fed up with rising fuel and insurance costs and are looking into organizing and trying to join together to take rigs off the road and that would mean shortages at supermarkets, convenience stores and if it was carried out to the extreme, eventually at every retail outlet in America.  Everything that gets delivered to a retail store in your city or town is eventually delivered by a truck, and if it were highly organized a strike could paralyze the economy.   Whether such a shutdown will take place, how widespread participation will be, and how effective such an action will be in ameliorating truckers\u2019 rising fuel expenses is something that will only be known in the aftermath. There is precedent for independent truck owners and operators banding together to strike over rising fuel costs (although the word \u201cstrike\u201d is being used here not in its familiar sense of an action waged against employers to force better wages, benefits, or working conditions for employees, but a work stoppage intended to paralyze industry and thereby force a change in government policy).  In February 1974, four months after OPEC had declared an oil embargo against the U.S. and other western nations over their support of Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, a group known as the Owners/Operators Independent Drivers Association of America staged a national strike to protest the spiraling costs of fuel, fuel shortages, and reduced speed limits. (In response to the OPEC oil embargo, President Nixon had signed a bill imposing a 55 MPH speed limit on interstate highways.)  The ten-day strike resulted in numerous acts of violence, prompting Pennsylvania governor Milton Shapp to activate National Guard units to assist in providing security for commercial vehicles and roadways.  The conditions that prompted the strike largely evaporated when OPEC ended its embargo the following month.

    "claim": "Scientists have determined a date in January is statistically the most depressing day of the year.",
    "content": " You needn\u2019t be an expert in psychology to pinpoint January as one of the least enjoyable months of the year: the excitement of the holidays has concluded while related bills begin rolling in, the coming of a new year is for many people a reminder of passing time that prompts sad reflections about missed opportunities and accomplishments, no extended breaks from school or work are in the offing, and in many parts of the northern hemisphere the weather is unpleasant if not downright dangerous. It\u2019s often cold and drab out, with summer a distant memory nearly half a year away. But is any date on the calendar in January statistically the most depressing day of the year? Social media users have frequently posted about \u201cBlue Monday,\u201d a term assigned to any number of specific days in January (typically the third monday of the month). Rumors abound that a particular date (typically a Monday) has been deemed by scientists or researchers to be the most depressing of the entire year, with a number of factors influencing the calculation of this bummer of a date. Going by popular lore, you might believe we scarcely can control our level of contentment on that day given all the mathematical reasons for us to be well and truly miserable. The concept of a \u201cBlue Monday\u201d took root in 2005. In that year, a press release detailed a purported formula that calculated factors including weather, debt, time elapsed since Christmas, and unsuccessful New Year\u2019s resolutions. When those factors were combined and the \u201csadness\u201d algorithm applied to them, 24 January 2005 was identified as the single most depressing of the year. Almost immediately the claim was regarded by many as a shaky one because the cited factors were clearly vague and nearly impossible to quantify, and because of the dubious impetus behind the \u201cformula.\u201d The calculations were attributed to a Dr. Cliff Arnall of the University of Cardiff in Wales, who explained:  \u201cFollowing the initial thrill of New Year\u2019s celebrations and changing over a new leaf, reality starts to sink in,\u201d Arnall said. \u201cThe realization coincides with the dark clouds rolling in and the obligation to pay off Christmas credit card bills.\u201d The formula was devised to help a travel company \u201canalyze when people book holidays and holiday trends,\u201d said Alex Kennedy, spokesperson for Porter Novelli, a London-based PR agency. It seems that people are most likely to buy a ticket to paradise when they feel like hell. \u201cPeople feel bleak when they have nothing planned, but once they book a holiday they have a goal, they work toward having time off and a relaxing period,\u201d Kennedy said.        If that sounded a bit like a paid placement by a public relations firm working on behalf of a travel company to increase vacation sales, it\u2019s because the \u201cresearch\u201d was exactly that. By 2006, Blue Monday\u2019s roots in public relations had been fully exposed via others working in scientific fields who\u2019d been offered the same financial opportunity as Arnall (who was a part-time tutor for night students at the time):  In fact it\u2019s not surprising that these equations are so stupid, because they come from the PR companies almost fully-formed and ready to have your name attached to them. I know that because I have received an avalanche of insider stories \u2014 Watergate it isn\u2019t \u2014 including one from an academic in psychology who was offered money by Porter Novelli PR agency to put his name to the very same Sky Travel equation story that Arnall sold his to. In amongst their aggressive pitch they described how the story would go. \u201cBlue Monday \u2014 January Blues Day is Officially Announced: The 26th of January is the most depressing day in the calendar for the majority of Brits as measured by a simple mathematical formula developed on behalf of Sky Travel. \u201cBy taking into account various factors such as avg temperature (C), days since last pay (P), days until next bank holiday (B), avg hours of daylight (D) and number of nights in during mth (N), we create a formula such as C(P+B) N+D. This formula allows us to work out the day with the highest \u2018depression factor\u2019 which you can then use as a focus for making things better, booking your holiday etc \u2026\u201d This is almost exactly as it was when Arnall revealed his important work to the world.  Arnall later followed up with a corresponding \u201chappiest day of the year\u201d formula, sponsored by the Wall\u2019s ice cream company. In the intervening years, journalists and mental health professionals have taken Arnall to task for minimizing the issue of clinical depression. He later commented on his involvement with PR-as-science, amusingly objecting to other people\u2019s fabricating information to promote a claim:  Despite criticism of his decision to accept money from PR firms, he insisted he had no regrets; in the past five years, he has earned a total \u00a31,650 for identifying the two dates. \u201cThere was one comment that I had bought a really big house out of the proceeds,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just make this stuff up.\u201d He added: \u201cI was originally asked to come up with what I thought was the best day to book a summer holiday but when I started thinking about the motives for booking a holiday, reflecting on what thousands had told me during stress management or happiness workshops, there were these factors that pointed to the third Monday in January as being particularly depressing \u2026 but it is not particularly helpful to put that out there and say \u2018there you are\u2019 \u2026 it is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy that it is the most depressing day.\u201d  While the initial Blue Monday PR campaign has long since concluded, the belief any one day in January is particularly or significantly the most depressing took on a life of its own. Not surprisingly, the claim has been repeatedly recycled by other companies seeking to promote goods or services in the post-holiday  winter period. And as social media became increasingly influential, the rumor evolved from a formula based on circumstances to an analysis of words used in tweets:  Blue Monday was originally identified in 2005 by academic Cliff Arnall, who thought it fell on the last full week of January. He calculated the date using a variety of factors including weather conditions, debt levels, failed New Year\u2019s resolutions and the number of days that had elapsed since the end of the Christmas holidays. But over the past three years, researchers analysed more than 2 million tweets posted by Britons in January looking for negative language and phrases indicating a drop in mood. They found that today, there will be nearly five times the average number of tweets relating to guilt, as people abandon their promises to pursue a healthier lifestyle.  In 2014, the Blue Monday story was reincarnated and harnessed by \u201cresearchers\u201d linked with (among other interests) an alcohol company, law firms, and a bottled water brand. In short, the specifics behind claims about January\u2019s hosting the most depressing day of the year have shifted, but the idea both originated with and is mainly advanced by marketers and public relations firms. No studies or evidence have proved any one calendar date is more gloomy than any others, and the formula linked with the calculation of such a date has no real scientific basis. Critics have noted that assigning arbitrary or transient causes (such as the arrival bills or the end of Christmas vacation) to clinical depression could adversely impact its sufferers by tacitly suggesting the condition is treatable through methods as simple as booking a vacation or buying a drink.

    "claim": "NASA issued a warning that Earth could be hit by an asteroid around Christmas 2019. ",
    "content": " On Oct. 23, 2019, the U.K. tabloid Express published an article that left some readers believing they need not make Christmas plans this year because Earth was in danger of being hit by a large asteroid:  The article was entitled \u201cAsteroid terror: NASA spot mammoth space rock to hit Earth\u2019s orbit five days before X-mas.\u201d The subheading gave earthlings an even smaller chance of survival: \u201cAN ASTEROID the size of the World Trade Centre is on a dangerous Earth-bound orbit that could see the rock smash the planet during Christmas festivities.\u201d When the article was regurgitated by even less-reputable websites, the fear-mongering title morphed into a factually inaccurate claim. For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title \u201cNASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!\u201d NASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas.        These articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there\u2019s nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1. NASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles. Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is \u201cnothing unusual or dangerous\u201d about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1: No, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth. Astronomers have been observing this asteroid\u2019s position for 13 years, we know its orbit very accurately, we can predict its close approaches accurately for the next 200 years, and we know with certainty that it cannot hit our planet. Lindley Johnson, NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Officer and Program Executive of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), also told us that this asteroid \u201cposes no hazard to impacting earth\u201d:  NASA and other US agencies are lead players in the international effort to develop plans to respond to a possible Near-Earth Object (NEO) impact. In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States\u2014and the world\u2014for detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic. NASA is approximately 35% complete for NEOs 140 meters and larger, and approximately 96% complete for those 1 km and larger. Strategic investments in our space-based programs will lead to the benefit of all of humanity as we continue to catalogue any NEOs that pose a potential threat. This particular asteroid\u2019s trajectory has been well tracked by NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies since it\u2019s discovery 13 years and poses no hazard to impacting Earth. Here\u2019s a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS. The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours):  On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026 \u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.       NASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does.  But the 19,000 NEOs in NASA\u2019s database aren\u2019t really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered: Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 \u2013 approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size \u2013 takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact \u2013 such as the Chelyabinsk event \u2013 could occur at any time. Still, the chances of an asteroid larger than 140 meters hitting earth in the next 100 years is minimal: The current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size\u2013larger than a small football stadium\u2013and to characterize a subset representative of the entire population. Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date. Asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 will pass by Earth a few days before Christmas. However, NASA has issued no warnings about a catastrophic impact, and CNEOS reports that this asteroid will get no closer than 3 million miles from Earth during its approach.  ",

    "claim": "Giveaways on the Las Vegas Travel and Las Vegas Vacations Facebook pages are legitimate.",
    "content": " In early March 2021, readers alerted us to a Facebook scam that involved a Bora Bora vacation getaway. This led us to revisit Facebook pages like Las Vegas Travel that advertised a Las Vegas vacation giveaway. We previously made note of the suspicious Vegas page in July 2020. At the time, we archived a post from a different, though similar one: Las Vegas Vacations. At least one of the pages had a Russian page manager. On July 2, we noticed that the Las Vegas Travel page had shared a post from Las Vegas Vacations. It mentioned a purported grand opening celebration for a resort. \u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate our grand opening by doing something special for you. We will be rewarding someone who has shared then commented by August 26th with a 7-night stay for up to 5 people in a luxury suite. Don\u2019t worry about flights and transfers, it\u2019s all included.\u201d  Just like with the Bora Bora getaway, the Las Vegas pages were illegitimate. They should be avoided for the possibility of phishing, identity theft, and other potential consequences. We strongly suggest against submitting any personal information to links on these pages.       Since July, the Las Vegas Travel page attempted to expand its scheme to Instagram. Meanwhile, the Las Vegas Vacations page was still running the \u201cGrand Opening Celebration\u201d scam.  For almost a year and a half, Facebook failed to take action on the illegitimate pages. The Las Vegas Travel Facebook page was created in 2019. As of March 2021, it had around 250,000 followers. Las Vegas Vacations was created in July 2020. It was building toward 50,000 followers. The scam appeared to work in a similar way to the Bora Bora getaway. In fact, the same person or group of people appeared to manage both fake giveaways. We came to this conclusion after noticing similarities in dates and text on the pages. Further, the same .xyz domain website was listed. Here\u2019s how the scam worked. First, Facebook users were asked to like, share, and comment with the word: \u201cWIN.\u201d This February \u2013 We are giving away 10 nights at the The Venetian Las Vegas for 5 people. Includes Flights, Accommodation &amp; Transfers. You will have 2 years to use the holiday! To participate: 1. Like 2. Share 3. Comment: \u201cWIN\u201d Closes 28th February at 9pm. Next, a personal Facebook profile that appeared to be a page responded to each entrant. (A Facebook profile is for an individual person. A page is for companies, bands, personalities, etc.)       The response to each entrant read: \u201cYou win. Check my profile.\u201d The profile named \u201cLas Vegas-Nevanda\u201d had a name in its Facebook URL: facebook.com/titis.ariandini. It read: \u201cTitis Ariandini.\u201d  Entrants who clicked to view the \u201cLas Vegas-Nevanda\u201d profile were led to yet another post. It advised Facebook users to visit a link to register for a prize.  One Facebook user named Jason appeared to believe the scam giveaway was real. In the same comment, he also referred to effective measures to reduce the chance of more deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic as a \u201ccommunist shutdown.\u201d The link in the post led to a registration page that mirrored scammy websites we\u2019ve seen before.  The registration page resulted in affiliate marketing links for streaming movie websites. This was where the Bora Bora getaway pages ended as well. The point of the affiliate marketing was for the scammers to make commissions on signups on the streaming movie websites. Again, it was also possible that the scam involved phishing, identity theft, and other dangerous outcomes. We found a number of other pages that shared the Las Vegas scams. They appeared to be in the same network of Facebook pages. They included: Maldives 2021, Bora Bora Vacations, Cancun Tours, New York Christmas Vacations, Maldives Getaways, Santorini \u2013 Greece, Package Holidays 2021, Dominican Republic Vacations 2021, Bali Tourism, Visit Hawaii, Seychelles Holidays, Tourism Bali, Cabo Tourism, Cabo San Lucas 2021, and Bali Holidays. We noticed that some of these pages were scrubbed of their past scam posts. This allowed the page managers to plead innocence and continue running their post-and-delete operations. Further, this list of pages perhaps only scratched the surface of the entire scam empire. In sum, the giveaways that showed up on the Las Vegas Travel and Las Vegas Vacations Facebook pages were not legitimate. Facebook failed to take action on these scams despite their existence dating back to at least 2019. As a rule, it\u2019s always good to look for the \u201cverified\u201d badge on Facebook pages. ",
