    "content": " Claim:   PETA placed bricks with hidden messages at baseball parks.  TRUE  Origins:   At the beginning of the 2004 baseball season, the San Diego Padres moved out of Qualcomm Stadium (formerly known as Jack Murphy Stadium and San Diego Stadium), the team\u2019s home since 1969, and into a new downtown ballpark called PETCO Park.  The Padres\u2019 new digs were named for their corporate sponsor, the PETCO chain of pet stores, vendors of pets and pet supplies at over 650 outlets in 43 states. PETCO purchased the naming rights to the Padres\u2019 new stadium for $60 million.       As has been done with many other public structures, a program was initiated at PETCO Park to raise revenue by allowing people to purchase personalized bricks inscribed with messages of their choosing.  The personalized bricks are put on permanent display in the stadium\u2019s Palm Court Plaza. The Ballpark Brick Program at PETCO Park presented an interesting opportunity for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who had written letters to Padres executives asking them to cancel the naming rights agreement.  PETA has long been urging consumers to boycott the PETCO chain on the grounds that numerous complaints have reported PETCO stores as all too often being the site of sick, dying, and mistreated animals:   PETA\u2019s national campaign against PETCO was launched in order to inform consumers of the pet-shop chain\u2019s bad habit of leaving animals sick and dying in its stores, pending lawsuits, and angry customers.  PETA is sending monthly casualty reports to PETCO officials, citing dozens of eyewitness accounts of sick and dying animals at PETCO stores across the country. During March [2004] alone, PETA received 59 complaints from 55 PETCO stores in 21 states. The reports can be read at PETCOCruelty.com.  PETA has also filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that PETCO failed to disclose animal deaths, customer complaints, and legal actions filed against the company (including lawsuits over cruelty to animals in San Francisco and Utah) to its stockholders. And PETA has filed a shareholder resolution calling on PETCO to end its sales of animals.   Although they may have failed at prevailing upon the Padres to change the name of their ballpark, purchasing a brick inscribed with an anti-PETCO message at PETCO Park would be a subversive way for PETA to take the battle to the enemy, so to speak, and that\u2019s exactly what they attempted to do.  However, Christy Griffin, PETA\u2019s PETCO Coordinator, told us that their initial two submissions were rejected as unsuitable: the first was for a brick bearing the message \u201cIn memory of all the animals who have suffered and died in PETCO stores nationwide,\u201d and the second was for a brick reading simply \u201cBoycott PETCO.\u201d   What to do when you can\u2019t get your message in through the front door?  As we\u2019ve seen in other examples, one way to sneak subversive messages into unlikely settings is through the backdoor method of acrostics, message spelled out by the initial letters of a series of words.  And again, that\u2019s exactly what PETA did, purchasing a brick with the inscription: \u201cBreak Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!\u201d:    Read as an acrostic, these sentences form a decidedly less friendly message:         Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The   Padres! Enjoy This Champion Organization!   According to Ms. Griffin, PETA\u2019s aim is to see PETCO give up the sale of live animals altogether, a product line which she says accounts for only 5% of PETCO\u2019s business. (PETCO officials maintain that they have investigated some of the reports submitted by PETA, and that most of them are \u201cmischaracterizations.\u201d) ESPN reported that PETCO wasn\u2019t expressing any public consternation over PETA\u2019s hidden message:   Padres and PETCO officials discussed whether something should be done with the brick, but PETCO executives had no problem with it. \u201cIf you walked by and read their message, you wouldn\u2019t know it had anything to do with PETA,\u201d said Don Cowan, PETCO\u2019s director of communications.   In 2012, PETA pulled off a similar caper at the Florida Marlins baseball team\u2019s new park.  Back in 2010, PETA had expressed opposition to the team\u2019s plans to install two enormous saltwater aquariums, complete with coral and sea life native to South Florida, in the backstop at that park:   \u201cBeing exposed to the loud crowds, bright lights, and reverberations of a baseball stadium would be stressful and maddening for any large animals held captive in tanks that, to them, are like bathtubs,\u201d wrote PETA executive vice president Tracy Reiman in a letter to [Marlins owner Jeffrey] Loria. PETA said the Marlins should explore alternatives, such as \u201cartist-designed aquariums full of beautiful blown-glass animals,\u201d \u201chigh-definition plasma screens showing underwater footage of sea animals,\u201d and even \u201crobotic fish that can \u2018swim\u2019 through water.\u201d \u201cI hope to hear that you have decided to leave fish in the ocean where they belong,\u201d Reiman wrote.   Prior to the April 2012 opening of the Marlins\u2019 new park, PETA purchased an engraved pavement stone to be placed in the park\u2019s East Plaza, a stone bearing the inscription \u201cFlorida Is Still Hosting Incredible Night Games. Help Us Reach The Stars. Cheer Our Marlins!\u201d  Read as an acrostic, these sentences also form a decidedly less friendly message:    Florida  Is   Still  Hosting  Incredible   Night   Games   Help   Us   Reach   The  Stars   Cheer   Oour  Marlins!     -->         The first letters of the words in the message spell out \u201cFishinghurts.com,\u201d a Web address that the animal right\u2019s organization said brings up a page on PETA\u2019s  website about cruelty involved in fishing. PETA said the hidden message is an effort to draw attention to the plight of fish, who the group says feel pain and suffer when they\u2019re caught on a hook or in a net. On its website, the organization said, \u201cMarlins are a species of fish. And they, like all fish, are much more beautiful alive and swimming in the ocean than on a menu. Fish (including marlins) feel pain, and they suffer when they\u2019re caught on a hook or in a net and dragged into an environment in which they can\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s much better to choose cruelty-free activities instead \u2014 like, say, watching a baseball game.\u201d   Additional information:           \u201cBoycott PETCO\u201d Message Sneaks Into Padres Ballpark            What\u2019s Wrong with PETCO?

    "content": " Claim:   Ronald Reagan once said (in reference to forest conservation efforts), \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one redwood, you\u2019ve seen them all.\u201d  Status:   Paraphrase.  Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2001] -->    In the 1960\u2019s there was a conflict in California between the lumber industry and citizens who wanted to protect redwood forests. Reagan, then governor of the state, took the position that large redwood forests were not necessary; at one meeting he said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one redwood tree, you\u2019ve seen them all.\u201d          Origins:   When Ronald Reagan first ran for public office, in the California gubernatorial election of 1966, environmental topics were high on the list of voter concerns.  Curbing air pollution, protecting undeveloped rivers from being dammed for commercial interests, and conserving what remained of the magnificent Redwood forests in the northern part of the state were significant campaign issues, and, as journalist Lou Cannon noted in his history of Reagan\u2019s governorship, Californians had some good reasons to believe that the actor-turned-politician might give those issues short shrift:   Reagan\u2019s knowledge of environmental issues, except for air pollution, was minimal. Even the geography of the north coast, where trees outnumbered people, eluded him. During the 1966 campaign, a reporter asked Reagan a question about the Eel River (a battleground between those who wanted to dam its middle fork and those who sought to preserve it as a wild river).  Reagan asked where it was. The reporter told the embarrassed candidate that he was standing alongside it.   How much of the remaining fraction of California\u2019s old-growth redwood forests should be preserved against commercial logging interests and converted to protected national parkland was a hot-button political issue at the time, pitting the timber industry against conservationists:   These splendid trees, rising to heights of more than 300 feet, flourish in a narrow coastal zone influenced by the Pacific Ocean fog. They were an early causes for  conservationists, who formed the Save-the-Redwoods League in 1913, embarked on a fund-raising campaign, and persuaded the Legislature to create three redwood state parks encompassing 27,500 acres.  The league donated half the land, and the state purchased the remainder from the lumber companies. This was an impressive achievement, but the parks were tiny in relation to the remaining redwood habitat of 1.5 million acres, reduced by logging to one-tenth its original size. Lumber companies, including Pacific Lumber, had their eyes on the surviving old-growth redwoods, which are more resistant than younger trees to rot and decay. A single redwood 2,000 years old yields 480,000 board feet of lumber.  The lumber companies had long opposed a national redwoods park. By the time Reagan took office, however, the industry had retreated under conservationist fire to the more defensible position of accepting a small national park in return for unrestricted logging outside of it. \u201cSmall\u201d was the operative word. Timber executives claimed that a large park would eliminate thousands of jobs. Using jobs as their battle cry, they mobilized business and labor support in the two counties (Del Norte and Humboldt) where land would be set aside for the Redwood National Park.   It was in this context that candidate (not yet governor) Ronald Reagan, while speaking before the Western Wood Products Association in San Francisco on 12 March 1966, said the following:   I think, too, that we\u2019ve got to recognize that where the preservation of a natural resource like the redwoods is concerned, that there is a common sense limit. I mean, if you\u2019ve looked at a hundred thousand acres or so of trees \u2014 you know, a tree is a tree, how many more do you need to look at?   While the issue candidate Reagan was addressing was a legitimate one \u2014 how to balance commercial interests against a desire to preserve natural resources for aesthetic reasons \u2014 he expressed his thoughts on the subject so coarsely that he came across as glib and callous, and incumbent governor Pat Brown\u2019s campaign soon mocked him by transforming his statement into the pithier \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one redwood, you\u2019ve seen them all,\u201d a phrase that was picked up by the press and widely circulated during the campaign.  (As Lou Cannon observed, the paraphrasing provided Reagan \u201can opportunity to say he was misquoted even though his actual words were arguably as damaging.\u201d) Why Reagan said what he did, and why he was so seemingly unresponsive to the conservationist side of the redwoods issue was something of a puzzle, according to Cannon:         Conservationists would have been even more frightened had they realized how perfectly this vacuous comment expressed Reagan\u2019s opinion. The conventional view of Reagan\u2019s statement \u2014 often misstated as \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one redwood, you\u2019ve seen them all\u201d \u2014 was that he had used artless language while pandering to an industry for campaign support. But the wood producers were already in Reagan\u2019s corner, and his well-financed campaign was not in need of their contributions. Reagan had said what he believed. Why he believed what he said, however, remains a mystery. Reagan, who was often attuned to nature, was strangely insensitive to the magnificence of the redwoods, long recognized as natural wonders of the world \u2026 Reagan was reluctant even to acknowledge the grandeur of the trees. Of one of the oldest and loveliest groves of redwoods, he said (on 15 March 1967), \u201cI saw them; there is nothing beautiful about them, just that they are a little higher than the others.\u201d Reagan had a stubborn streak \u2026 and his statements in part reflected his unwillingness to be pushed around by environmental groups.   Eventually, as is often the case, the issue was settled by a political compromise worked out through federal government.  In 1968, Congress authorized the creation of the 58,000-acre Redwood National Park, which included 27,500 acres of state parkland as well as 5,000 acres of coastal property in Del Norte and Humboldt counties that were ceded to the state of California by lumber companies; in return, 13,000 acres of Forest Service land in Del Norte County (known as the Northern Redwood Purchase Unit) were transferred to the lumber companies.

    "claim": "Official Department of Interior Twitter accounts were temporarily deactivated after the National Park Service account was used to retweet negative information about the incoming Trump administration.",
    "content": " On 20 January 2017, the day Donald J. Trump took office as President of the United States, news outlets posted photos purporting to compare the size of the crowd attending Trump\u2019s inauguration to that attending Barack Obama\u2019s first inaugural ceremony in 2009. Although there was not yet an official count of how many people actually showed up at the Trump event, so an accurate numerical comparison couldn\u2019t be made, the photos did appear to show a significant disparity between the sizes of the crowds, with far fewer in attendance at Trump\u2019s inauguration than Obama\u2019s. For obvious reasons, the side-by-side images were relished by anti-Trump factions, who shared and retweeted them all day long. There was one instance in particular wherein a retweet of the photos caught the attention of incoming Trump officials, who deemed them inappropriate \u2014 so inappropriate, in fact, that the Department of Interior promptly deactivated every one of its Twitter accounts in response. The offending retweet (since deleted) appeared on the National Park Service (@NatlParkService) Twitter feed:        This was followed by another retweet (since deleted) of a text suggesting that the Trump administration had scrubbed information from the White House web site for ideological reasons:  All of which caused a small uproar on Twitter, where some users joked that the National Park Service had \u201cgone rogue,\u201d others wondered about the legality of the retweets, and still others defended their content as \u201cfactual, not anti-Trump.\u201d Later that day, the NPS Twitter account, along with all the other Department of Interior accounts, went silent. According to a report by CNN, the order came down from a \u201ccareer staffer\u201d at the department:  After the retweet began to get attention, a career staffer at the Interior Department instructed employees that the \u201cnew administration has said that the department and all bureau are not supposed to tweet this weekend and wait for guidance until Monday.\u201d  The message continued, \u201cPlease make sure that any scheduled tweets are no longer scheduled.\u201d  In statements to The Washington Post, a National Park Service spokesperson explained why the action was taken and said it would only be temporary: Thomas Crosson, a spokesman for the National Park Service, the Interior agency whose employee retweeted the offending tweets, said the action was \u201cinconsistent with the agency\u2019s approach to engaging the public through social media.\u201d \u201cThe Department of Interior\u2019s communications team determined that it was important to stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety,\u201d Crosson said in an email. \u201cNow that social media guidance has been clarified, the Department and its bureaus should resume Twitter engagement as normal this weekend.\u201d With one exception, Crosson said: No social media posts on the policy priorities of the new Interior secretary, because Trump nominee Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) has not yet been confirmed. Indeed, by the next morning, U.S. Department of Interior Twitter accounts went online again, commencing with a note of contrition tweeted by @NatlParkService:  We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you pic.twitter.com/mctNNvlrmv \u2014 NationalParkService (@NatlParkService) January 21, 2017 There has been no announcement regarding who may have been responsible for the retweets, or whether disciplinary action would be taken.

    "title": "Did Visitors to Joshua Tree National Park Cut Down Trees During the Government Shutdown?",

    "claim": "Some visitors to Joshua Tree National Park cut down trees and perpetrated other acts of vandalism in January 2019 while staff, whose numbers were diminished due to the federal government shutdown, attempted to monitor visitor behavior. ",
    "content": " The U.S. federal government shutdown, which entered its 21st day on 11 January 2019, had a significant negative impact on one institution of American life in particular: the national parks. With staff cut back to a minimum, monuments, forests, and wilderness areas around the country saw a buildup of trash and human waste, and volunteer groups were required to intervene in an effort to perform whatever maintenance and cleaning they could. In January, it was widely reported that three deaths had occurred in national parks during the shutdown, although it\u2019s not at all clear that those deaths would have been prevented if the parks in question had been fully staffed. On 10 January, \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d Facebook page linked vandalism at the iconic Joshua Tree National Park in California to a lack of staff caused by the ongoing shutdown: \u201cDuring the shutdown, with Joshua Tree National Park open but no staff on duty, visitors cut down Joshua trees so they could drive into sensitive areas where vehicles are banned. The destroyed trees are irreplaceable; they take sixty years to mature and live for more than 500 years.\u201d        The key claim in the widely-shared meme, that staffing shortages contributed to the destruction of some of the iconic eponymous Yucca brevifolia trees at Joshua Tree National Park, is accurate, according to facts confirmed and descriptions provided by park management. Although it wasn\u2019t correct to say that \u201cno staff\u201d were on duty during the shutdown, staff numbers were very heavily diminished.  On 8 January, the National Park Service (NPS) announced that they would be temporarily closing Joshua Tree \u201cto allow park staff to address sanitation, safety, and resource protection issues in the park that have arisen during the lapse in appropriations\u201d: Park officials are identifying the additional staff and resources needed to address immediate maintenance and sanitation issues and will utilize funds from the park fees to address those issues per the recently updated National Park Service contingency plan during a lapse in appropriations. While the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree National Park do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure. Law enforcement rangers will continue to patrol the park and enforce the closure until park staff complete the necessary cleanup and park protection measures. In an interview with the National Parks Traveller website (which published a photograph of one of the downed trees), Joshua Tree National Park Superintendent David Smith gave further details on the vandalism perpetrated in the park in early January: \u201cThere are about a dozen instances of extensive vehicle traffic off roads and in some cases into wilderness,\u201d Smith replied when asked about the damage in the park. \u201cWe have two new roads that were created inside the park. We had destruction of government property with the cutting of chains and locks for people to access campgrounds. We\u2019ve never seen this level of out-of-bounds camping. Every day use area was occupied every evening. Joshua trees were actually cut down in order to make new roads.\u201d According to National Parks Traveller, Smith also drew a clear connection between the significant cut in staff numbers during the shutdown and the ability of park staff to monitor visitor behavior and prevent the kind of damage seen in recent days: Monitoring a park the size of Joshua Tree, which covers 1,235 square miles and has about 20 different entrances due to dirt roads that ring the park, is extremely difficult with just eight law enforcement rangers. Were it not for the shutdown, there would have been more than 100 other \u201csets of eyes\u201d to help keep an eye on visitor behavior, the superintendent said. \u201cWe have 120 employees in the park, plus 30 associates that work for Great Basin Institute, the majority of whom are in the park every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the folks that are in the campgrounds and in the day-use areas and doing science. So you\u2019ve got 100 sets of eyes in the park every day with folks contacting visitors.\u201d The following day, 9 January, the National Park Service announced a reversal of the decision to temporarily close Joshua Tree, writing that management, acting on a controversial directive from acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, would use funds derived from visitor fees in order to bring back the staff needed to keep the park open: By immediately utilizing revenue generated by recreation fees, National Park Service officials have been able to avert a temporary closure of Joshua Tree National Park that had been previously scheduled for January 10. In addition, recently closed areas of the park will once again be accessible to visitors starting January 10. Some visitor services, including campgrounds and entrance stations, will reopen utilizing recreation fee revenue. National Park Service officials have determined that by using Federal Land and Recreation Enhancement funds to immediately bring back park maintenance crews to address sanitation issues, the park will be able to maintain some visitor services, including reopening the campgrounds. Crucially, the announcement again drew a direct link between diminished staff numbers caused by the government shutdown, and the earlier destruction of trees at Joshua Tree National Park: The park will also bring on additional staff to ensure the protection of park resources and mitigate some of the damage that has occurred during the lapse of appropriations.

    "claim": "Law professor Alice Ristroph wrote in the Atlantic magazine that the 2017 solar eclipse, its path, or those who viewed it, were \"racist.\"",
    "content": " In August 2017, two right-wing web sites falsely reported that a law professor had written that a 2017 solar eclipse was \u201cracist.\u201d First, the Daily Caller published an article headlined \u201cThe Eclipse Is Racist Because It Fails to Affect Enough Black People, the Atlantic Suggests,\u201d stating that \u201cThe Atlantic, a once-great magazine, has determined that the total eclipse of the sun due to occur on Monday will fail to affect enough black people.\u201d The following day, the Conservative Tribune asserted in a similar vein: \u201cAre you looking forward to Monday\u2019s solar eclipse \u2014 the first full eclipse to hit the United States in decades? You filthy, filthy racist. That\u2019s at least the take of Brooklyn Law School professor Alice Ristroph, who used a staggering 4,544 words in The Atlantic to explaining why the phenomenon of the moon blocking the sun just wasn\u2019t diverse enough for her tastes.\u201d Both web sites were referring to an essay by Alice Ristroph, a professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York. Her essay, originally published in Democracy under the title \u201cBlackout,\u201d and republished by the Atlantic on 18 August 2017, did not state \u2014 or even imply \u2014 that the eclipse itself or the path of its totality were \u201cracist.\u201d Nor did Ristroph say or imply that the eclipse would not be visible to \u201cenough\u201d black people, or that those who chose to view the eclipse were \u201cracists.\u201d Instead, Ristroph penned a lyric essay that used the path of the eclipse as a literary mechanism to explore the United States\u2019 troubled racial history of \u201ctotality\u201d and \u201cdivision.\u201d In noting that the path of the eclipse would cross sections of the United States in which there lived \u201calmost no black people,\u201d Ristroph was clear to state that this circumstance was a coincidence (from an astronomical standpoint) but used that fact as an opportunity to examine the historical reasons why some areas of America remain predominantly non-black. Along the way, she discussed different visions of \u201ctotality,\u201d such as Oregon\u2019s original goal of being an all-white state, and General William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s vision of \u201ctotal war\u201d during the U.S. Civil War.       At no point did Ristroph use the word \u201cracist,\u201d and she explicitly made the (blindingly obvious) point that the eclipse itself did not harbor any racial prejudice:  It has been dubbed the Great American Eclipse, and along most of its path, there live almost no black people. Presumably, this is not explained by the implicit bias of the solar system. It is a matter of population density, and more specifically geographic variations in population density by race, for which the sun and the moon cannot be held responsible \u2026 The shadow of the moon doesn\u2019t care where it falls or who lives below.  In 2015, the Daily Caller similarly prevaricated about a New York Times opinion piece on the subject of low visitation rates at national parks by minorities.  Under the headline \u201cNow America\u2019s National Parks Are Racist,\u201d the Daily Caller wrote:  The cozily white opinion pages of The New York Times attacked the National Park Service and America\u2019s majestic national parks as racist because way too many white people visit them. Also, the visitors are old. And about 80 percent of the park service\u2019s employees are white. Thus, \u201cminorities are unwelcome.\u201d  One again, the Daily Caller completely misrepresented the thrust of a race-related discussion.  The New York Times article in question, by Glenn Nelson, did not decry either America\u2019s national parks or the National Park Service as being \u201cracist,\u201d nor did that word appear anywhere in Nelson\u2019s piece.   The gist of Nelson\u2019s article was that attendance at U.S. national parks by minorities was comparatively low, that a primary reason for that phenomenon was unfamiliarity with national parks among minorities, and that the National Park Service should try to encourage broader visitation through outreach aimed at clearing up such unfamiliarity. Nelson did not assert, as the Daily Caller misrepresented, that \u201cminorities are unwelcome\u201d at U.S. national parks.  In fact, he argued the opposite \u2014 that the National Park Service should attempt to dispel the misperception among minorities that they were not welcome at national parks:  [M]any minorities say they know little about the nation\u2019s parks or what to expect when visiting them. In the 2011 park service survey, nonwhites were more than three times as likely as whites to say that the parks provided poor service and were not safe to visit. And those responses were from nonvisitors, which means that perceptions had congealed into reality among what should be an important constituency for the parks. We need to demolish the notion that the national parks and the rest of nature are an exclusive club where minorities are unwelcome. The park service[\u2018s] \u2026 outreach should be tailored to minorities and delivered where they log in, follow, Tweet, view or listen. The park service needs to shout to minorities from its iconic mountaintops, \u201cWe want you here!\u201d  On 12 January 2017, President Barack Obama took up that suggestion, issuing a memorandum on \u201cDiversity and Inclusion in Our National Parks\u201d that directed federal agencies (among other actions) to engage in conducting \u201cactive outreach to diverse populations\u201d and \u201cidentifying and making improvements to existing programs to increase visitation and access by diverse populations\u201d \u2014 \u201cparticularly minority, low-income, and disabled populations and tribal communities.\u201d ",

    "claim": "The U.S. National Park Service is selling Trump-branded wines at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.",
    "content": " On 21 November 2017, the energy and environment-oriented publication E&amp;E News reported that Trump-branded wines were being sold at a gift shop in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah National Park. Bill Snape, a lawyer representing an environmental organization that is suing President Donald Trump, had tipped off the publication about the situation: Looking for some Trump wine for the holiday? Head no farther than Shenandoah National Park, where you can pick it up at the Skyland Resort. That\u2019s according to Bill Snape, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, who wants to get to the bottom of why it\u2019s sold there. Although it\u2019s true that Trump Winery products were being sold at a gift shop located at a national park in Virginia, the store is operated by Delaware North, a private company under contract to provide \u201clodging, food and beverage, retail services and activities\u201d to park visitors. Furthermore, according to Delaware North spokeswoman Victoria Hong, the company had been selling wines produced by that particular vineyard since before the Trump Winery acquired it: Wherever we operate across the country, we support local and regional producers and farmers by offering their products in our retail stores. It\u2019s our decision as the concessioner to determine which local and regional products to buy and offer park visitors. At Shenandoah National Park we offer wines from several different Virginia vintners. Because they are locally produced, we had also offered wines from the Trump Winery and its predecessor, Kluge Estate, prior to September. This was only at Shenandoah, where it is a local product, and not at any other parks. The National Park Service did not request or require us to carry it. Donald Trump purchased the winery, which is located in Charlottesville, Virginia, from Patricia Kluge in 2011. Trump\u2019s middle son, Eric, is currently the company\u2019s president. Bill Snape, an attorney with the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity told The Hill that he felt the wine sales at the park \u201cabsolutely\u201d raised conflict of interest concerns. However, Mark Leach, a manager for the Delaware North stores at Shenandoah told that publication that save for a purchase of ros\u00e9 in late Spring 2017, the company hasn\u2019t acquired any more Trump wine to sell since 2016 because they want to stay out of politics. But the controversy over Trump-branded wine\u2019s placement in government-related shops, regardless of how long it\u2019s been sold there or why, drives concerns about various ethics issues that have plagued President Trump, who is a businessman with a multitude of real estate and commercial deals branded with his name. President Trump is being sued by multiple parties over allegations of conflicts of interest and violations of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bars U.S. lawmakers from receiving foreign gifts.

    "content": " The 21st century has certainly been a more tumultuous time for debunking than the early years of this website. We\u2019ve all seen the world-changing events of the last two decades, the increasing dangers of conspiracy theories, and the rise of misinformation on social media. However, it\u2019s nice to take a moment to return to one subject that was there at the beginning of our founding: Disney Parks. This story doesn\u2019t have anything to do with breaking news events or political controversy. Even better, the letter Q doesn\u2019t appear anywhere below. This is all about a hot dog stuffed inside a pickle, surrounded by what looked to be corn dog batter, served with a side of peanut butter. The Pickle Corn Dog On March 31, 2021, a photograph was shared on social media that purportedly showed a brand new Disneyland Resort snack:        This is a real Disney Parks culinary creation. Even better, patrons don\u2019t need a ticket into the park or a reservation in order to try it.  Disneyland is advertising a hot dog stuffed inside a dill pickle that is fried and served with a side of peanut butter. (Heart defibrillators 50 cents extra.) pic.twitter.com/oLEMjyMCvO \u2014 Brooks Barnes (@brooksbarnesNYT) March 31, 2021  According to the Disney Parks Blog, the \u201cPickle Corn Dog\u201d would be available in the Downtown Disney District. This location is outside of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park.  Disney Parks Best Bites: April 2021 We have a buffet of food and beverage news in this April 2021 edition of Disney Parks Best Bites. We are listing Earth Month treats along with a returning brunch offering, pickle corn dogs, cereal-sly delicious offerings, and more. Check out all these Best Bites! \u2026 A hot dog stuffed in a pickle with a panko crust? Seriously? Count me in! Blue Ribbon Corn Dogs Cart, Downtown Disney District Pickle Corn Dog \u2013 Panko-crusted dill pickle corn dog served with a side of peanut butter Aside from the corn dog news, perhaps the even bigger announcement was that alcohol would be available for the first time at a Disneyland Park restaurant. The Blue Bayou Restaurant would begin to offer \u201cwine, beer, and a specialty Hurricane Cocktail \u2013 a New Orleans staple!\u201d In the past, the only place where alcohol was available in Disneyland Park was Club 33. The club is only open to members and their guests. And if you can\u2019t make it out to Disneyland to try the new \u201cPickle Corn Dog\u201d snack, we found a YouTuber who can help you make one at home. So in sum, yes, a hot dog stuffed inside a pickle surrounded by corn dog batter and panko crust was being served with a side of peanut butter at Disneyland Resort\u2019s Downtown Disney District.

    "content": "  Claim:   Photograph shows Mount Rushmore obscured by a helicopter-suspended sheet due to the federal government shutdown.  FALSE        Example:   [Collected via e-mail, October  2013]  Is Mount Rushmore really being covered during government shutdown? A picture is going around on FB showing two helicopters with a large piece of fabric (white sheets) hanging from them covering the faces on Mt. Rushmore.  Says Obama ordered this!       Origins:   One of the effects of the federal government shutdown of October 2013 has been the closure of public access to parks, battlefields, monuments, and historic houses under the jurisdiction of the federal government.  Although in some areas visitors may still be able to reach,  drive through, or view (from a distance) various national parks and other historic sites, all national park facilities, trails, visitor centers, and the like are closed.         One of the sites affected by the government shutdown is the famous Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota, which features the likenesses of four U.S. presidents carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore.  That site was the subject of some controversy because \u2014 as with other national parks \u2014 not only were its visitor center, viewing areas, and trails closed with the onset of the government shutdown (thereby preventing tourists from accessing some of the best vantage points for viewing the sculpture), but the National Park Service initially placed cones along a nearby highway that prevented motorists from stopping and snapping photos of the monument at roadside viewing areas:  The National Park Service placed cones along highway viewing areas outside Mount Rushmore, barring visitors from pulling over and taking pictures of the famed monument. The cones first went up Oct. 1, said Dusty Johnson, [South Dakota] Gov. Dennis Daugaard\u2019s chief of staff. The state asked that they be taken down, and federal officials did so with some of them. The state was told the cones were a safety precaution to help channel cars into viewing areas rather than to bar their entrance. \u201cI think reasonable people can disagree about that,\u201d Johnson said. The cones were down again [three days later] as a blizzard hit the Black Hills and plows needed access to the roads, Johnson said. He said the state would be monitoring to see whether the cones are put back along viewing areas. \u201cOnce the snow\u2019s off the ground, we\u2019re going to be keeping an eye on how the cones go up,\u201d Johnson said.       The widely circulated image of the sheet-toting helicopters shown above is nothing more than a digital manipulation created as a humorous illustration to a similar article, however.  The Mount Rushmore National Memorial has not been obscured from view by a large sheet suspended from helicopters (a patently silly notion) or anything else.  Although visitors may not currently be able to access some of Mount Rushmore\u2019s best viewing points, the monument itself remains visible anywhere from which it normally could be seen.
