    "title": "Did NASA Fund Theological Research To Study How Humans Would React to Extraterrestrial Life?",

    "claim": "NASA provided $1.1 million in funding to a religious organization to study how humans may react to life beyond Earth. ",
    "content": " NASA made new headlines in late 2021 for an old program that supposedly funded an effort to understand how humans would react to life beyond our home planet. While the hunt for alien life isn\u2019t anything new, the take on the search was: The space agency was said by publications like the New York Post to have hired theologians to \u201cto understand how humans will react to news that intelligent life exists on other planets.\u201d The story picked up speed in late December and was covered by a number of publications. It also made for an interesting gab on social media:  NASA just hired 24 theologians to assess how the world would react if we discovered alien life and I have a feeling this subplot in the season finale of 2021 is planting the seeds for the main storyline of 2022 \u2014 Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) December 26, 2021  And while the claim is largely true, it is based on events that happened years ago. In an email to Snopes, NASA confirmed that it had partially funded research conducted by the nonprofit organization Center for Theological Inquiry (CTI), in Princeton, New Jersey. (The institution is not affiliated with the university as some publications reported.) But the grant ended after two years and the space agency was not involved in the selection of researchers involved in the study, nor were any of the scientists directly employed by NASA       \u201cAddressing the societal implications of astrobiology and, specifically, the potential societal impact of finding life beyond Earth, has been a goal of NASA since 1998,\u201d a spokesperson told Snopes. \u201cThe agency\u2019s Astrobiology program provided partial funding through a grant to the CTI in 2015 to assess societal implications for NASA\u2019s astrobiological and search for life efforts.\u201d NASA further noted that the researchers involved in the study were selected exclusively by CTI. \u201cNASA was not involved in the selection of researchers for this study, and individuals who receive grant funding from NASA are not employees, advisors, or spokespersons for the agency,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cThus, the researchers and scholars involved with this study were not hired by NASA, but instead received funding through CTI to conduct this work.\u201d In an email to Snopes, CTI specified that its research was not a search for aliens, nor did its scientists work for or advise NASA on that topic. Rather, the work focused on \u201cthe scientific study of the potential of the Universe to harbor microbial life beyond Earth.\u201d \u201cThe grant was awarded to enable scholars in the Humanities to become conversant with the current science of astrobiology, and to study its implications for humanity\u2019s views of the natural world in religion and society,\u201d a spokesperson told Snopes. They added that the work is available in the institution\u2019s magazine, Fresh Thinking (Issue No. 1, 2018, pages 32-45; Issue No. 2, 2019, pages 6 to 15). The story originated on Dec. 22, 2021, when the United Kingdom-based newspaper The Times published an interview with a British priest, Reverend Andrew Davidson, who was among 24 theologians to have taken part in the NASA-sponsored program. Davidson was speaking to his upcoming book, \u201cAstrobiology and Christian Doctrine,\u201d set to be published in 2022. A blog stub published by the University of Cambridge further confirmed the work in collaboration with NASA. Davidson, who was a Starbridge Lecturer in Theology and Natural Science at the time of the study, described is project as \u201ceasy to define.\u201d       \u201cI am researching and writing a survey of the main topics in Christian belief \u2014 what is sometimes called \u2018systematic theology\u2019 \u2014 from the perspective of life elsewhere in the universe. I am thinking about its bearing on the doctrines of creation, sin, the person and work of Jesus, redemption, revelation, eschatology, and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cI see my main task as identifying, and working with, parts of the theological tradition that could bear directly upon the topic, even though they have not yet been brought to bear\u2026 So far, my attention has mainly been focused on what theologians call Christology: the discussion of who Jesus was, and in particular of what it would mean to hold that he is both human and divine.\u201d CTI described itself as \u201cconvening theologians and researchers in the humanities and sciences to think together on God and global concerns.\u201d But at the time of the initial funding, the question over whether government funds ought to be allocated to a religious institution, specifically one of Christian orientation, was a controversial one. A letter written by the freedom from Religion Foundation in June 2016 formally requested that NASA rescind the grant, calling it \u201cboth unconstitutional and unnecessary\u201d and an \u201cegregious misuse of secular tax dollars.\u201d Snopes contacted CTI for more information about the findings of the research but did not receive a response as of this writing. We will update the article accordingly. However, an article published by Davidson in 2018 in the journal Theology and Science described his research: Christian theologians have considered the significance of life elsewhere in the cosmos since the fifteenth century, but the brevity of these discussions calls for greater theological precision: the notion of multiple incarnations, for example, is often explored without reference to the detail of Christological formulations. Attention to the logical mode in which such work is set out is also fruitful, where the scholastic category of suitability or fittingness holds particular promise. As suitable, God\u2019s actions are free and yet congruent, being consistent with the divine nature, with creaturely natures, and with the ends of God\u2019s dealings with creatures. Other research posits similar questions, arguing that the study of astrobiology and its intersect with theology present broad consequences, as billions of people around the world subscribe to religious beliefs. Finding extraterrestrial life could exacerbate theological questions surrounding the human origin story, the purpose of life, and could raise concerns that affect how humans conduct themselves, such as begging the question of ethical responsibilities toward life discovered beyond earth.

    "claim": "Between March and August 2020, \"how to hit a woman so no one knows\" was typed into Google 163 million times \u2014 a 31% spike compared to the number of such searches during the same months in 2019.",
    "content": " In late April 2021, social media posts, like the one displayed below, Google users allegedly asked the search engine \u201chow to a hit a woman so now one knows\u201d more often during the first phase of lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 than during the same time frame the previous year.  The claim originated from media sources including Blavity (a Los Angeles-based platform serving Black millennials), UNILAD (a British media outlet), and MSNBC (an American cable network owned by NBC Universal). We obtained an archived version of an April 26 opinion column by the latter outlet, a piece of commentary that cited peer-reviewed research analyzing Google searches from the beginning of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 to the end of August that year. The MSNBC article said: [Millions] of men appear to be doing some very specific research about how to assault the women around them. Published in The Journal of General Psychology, the study was led by Katerina Standish, the deputy director and senior lecturer at the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand. \u2018How to hit a woman so no one knows\u2019 was typed into Google 163 million times, a 31 percent increase compared to 2019.       In other words, Google users purportedly searched \u201chow to hit a woman so no one knows\u201d 163 million times between March and August 2020, and that number was 31 percent higher than the amount of same searches during those months the previous year. However, that was not true. One day after the MSNBC column published, onlookers identified flaws in the research\u2019s methodology, and its author confirmed the findings were inaccurate. As a result, the news outlet removed the above-transcribed section from its article citing the research. (That updated version of the story remained live online as of this writing.) We looked at Google search data ourselves. By searching the phrase \u201chow to hit a woman so no one knows,\u201d the platform produces billions of returns \u2014 or websites or posts that contain those keywords. That is not the same as the number of times users searched the question (we explain how to find that quantity below), and it appeared to grow significantly after the MSNBC article and other media coverage.  By using the separate Google Trends search engine \u2014 a tool that compiles data for Google search queries worldwide \u2014 we learned that relatively no one used the website to look for information on \u201chow to hit a woman so no one knows,\u201d including during the time window referenced in the study (March to August 2020).  Next, to fully explore the issue, we reached out to Standish (the author of the study called, \u201cCOVID-19, suicide, and femicide: Rapid Research using Google search phrase\u201c) to learn about her research process and its shortcomings. She responded to us via email, saying she indeed mistook the amount of search returns for the number of times Google users entered the phrase looking for answers. After the revelation, she said she alerted The Journal of General Psychology of the error and requested an assessment of the entire study.       \u201cThe results are meaningless \u2026 all I have done is demonstrate a rise in web pages over the year. Not at all what I thought I was doing,\u201d Standish said. \u201c[The] goal of the study was to look for people who were hurting to elevate what they are going through and to help.\u201d Additionally, Standish apologized for the research\u2019s flaws on Twitter:   \u201cThe first time I googled these terms my heart skipped\u2026I was shocked,\u201d she continued in a tweet thread. \u201cI sincerely apologise and will make amends.\u201d In sum, we rate this claim \u201cfalse\u201d \u2014 millions of people, presumably men, did not turn to Google for help to seemingly conceal physical abuse against their female partners during the early months of the pandemic. If you or someone you know is experiencing abuse from an intimate partner, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE) or text LOVEIS to 22522 for anonymous, confidential help.

    "claim": "A law in Iowa forbids people from kissing for more than five minutes.",
    "content": " The claim that Iowans are legally prohibited from kissing for more than five minutes has been circulating on the internet for more than a decade. While this \u201cdumb law\u201d has been reported by dozens of web sites, it appears to have originated on a joke web site and not with any actual legislation. This is frequently shared on social media and has appeared on web sites such as Only In Your State, news outlets such as My San Antonio, and books such as The Duh Awards: In This Stupid World, We Take the Prize. While this \u201cdumb law\u201d has been shared far and wide on the internet, the majority of these outlets fail to provide any evidence that this law actually exists; when a web site does provide a source link, it is typically directed at the web site Dumblaws.com: Kisses may last for no more than five minutes. While Dumblaws.com does provide the \u201cfull text of the law\u201d for many of its items, several laws (including Iowa\u2019s alleged kissing law) are presented without proof. This isn\u2019t surprising, as Dumblaws.com writes in its FAQ section that the web site is for \u201centertainment only\u201d and that the laws appearing on the site have not been properly fact-checked: We have done our best to maintain the accuracy of this database, however, we are not lawyers and do not have the time nor resources to explore the topic as thoroughly as we would like. If you have information that conflicts with ours, please let me know! For those who like fine print: I make no representation, expressed or implied, regarding the accuracy of the material posted on this web site. It is for entertainment only, and you should do your own research before using this information for any purpose The earliest mention of this law that we could uncover appeared on a humor web site in 1998. While \u201cJames Fuqua\u2019s Law Jokes\u201d does offer a few citations, the listing for Iowa\u2019s kissing law is \u2014 once again \u2014 presented without evidence. Our search of the Iowa Legislature also came up empty handed. While we found dozens of laws related to kissing, largely connected to sexual assault or child abuse, we found no record of Iowa legally limiting the length of a kiss.  At any rate, it seems that it would be a difficult law to enforce. ",

    "claim": "A viral Facebook post about \"the perfect woman\" repeated an authentic quote from Bob Marley.",
    "content": " In May 2021, tens of thousands of Facebook users shared the below-displayed post about Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley in an attempt to empower women who feel insecure about their bodies. The post alleged: Bob Marley was once asked if the perfect woman existed. And he replied: Who cares about perfection? Even the moon is not perfect, it is full of craters\u2026 And the sea? it\u2019s too salty and dark in the depths. The sky? Always so infinite, that is, the most beautiful things are not perfect, they are special. Stop wanting to be \u201cperfect\u201d, try to be free, happy and live doing what you love, not wanting to please others.  We found other posts with the same quote. Some also cited Marley, though without any evidence to substantiate whether he actually made the comment, and others circulated the quote without attribution. None of the posts stemmed from reputable media sources, such as published biographies or scholarly articles. Next, we attempted to prove or disprove whether anyone had indeed asked Marley \u201cif the perfect woman existed\u201d before his death in 1981, as well as proof to determine if the post accurately repeated his response to the question.       Firstly, we searched a database of archives from major news outlets globally for all instances in which journalists used the phrases \u201cBob Marley\u201d and \u201cperfect woman\u201d in a single issue between 1945 and 1981 (the duration of Marley\u2019s life). The search uncovered two results from 1979 in which reporters working for The News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina) and The Sacramento Bee (Sacramento, California) used the terms in two separate articles on the same newspaper pages. Below, for example, is The Sacramento Bee:  In other words, no journalist for a major news outlet asked Marley the alleged question about a \u201cperfect woman\u201d \u2014 nor did the famous singer supposedly respond to the inquiry like the Facebook post claimed \u2014 according to archives available to Snopes. It was possible, however, someone doing less-formal journalism documented the moment with Marley, and that the database did not include that evidence because of the nature of the reporting. Next, we used an online portal of song lyrics by Marley and his former band, Bob Marley &amp; The Waliers, to see whether the artist mentioned \u201cperfection\u201d in one or more popular tracks. Based on our review of that evidence, totaling dozens of songs, no lyric included the term, thus discrediting the possibility that Marley wrote the alleged comment about women (or a version of it) into one of his records. Again, it was possible a lesser-known song, or one that did not make it to mainstream production, by Marley included the alleged sentiment about women. Next, we considered other research into the same question. According to Google Trends, which tracks how many users have conducted searches using specific keyword phrases, relatively no one used the search engine to see whether Marley had made the comment regarding \u201cperfection\u201d or \u201cthe perfect woman\u201d in recent years. That finding indicated that academics, archivists, and musicologists were generally not interested in the alleged quote while piecing together biographies about Marley. Lastly, we reached out to the publishing company W.W. Norton &amp; Company, which circulated \u201cBob Marley Spirt Dancer,\u201d to try to contact that book\u2019s co-author, Roger Steffens. Steffens is a reggae historian and \u201cBob Marley expert\u201d (according to The Los Angeles Times) who\u2019s interviewed the musician\u2019s inner circle for research projects. Norton &amp; Company has not returned our message, but we will update this report if that changes, and whether Steffens provides us with any evidence to help investigate this claim. In sum, while no verified evidence confirmed the authenticity of the above-displayed Facebook post regarding Marley, as of this writing, it was possible he made the alleged comment at some point during his life. For that reason, we rate this claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d ",

    "claim": "Bill Gates is being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations.",
    "content": " Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we\u2019ve learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   During the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, a popular social media meme asserted that philanthropist Bill Gates was partnered with business magnate George Soros in owning a lab in Wuhan, China (the presumed location where the COVID-19 outbreak originated), and was being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations:  It is true that the Microsoft co-founder, through his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has expended billions of dollars funding research and childhood-immunization programs in developing countries. Gates, who has long warned that we are inadequately prepared to deal with global pandemics, has also pledged to make billions of dollars available for funding the manufacture of vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a member of the Leadership Council for the Gates Foundation\u2019s Decade of Vaccines Collaboration effort launched in 2010. However, the meme jumps the rails at suggesting anything more than that Gates is interested in improving lives through medical research and vaccinations. Gates does not own a lab in Wuhan, China, in partnership with Soros; that claim is a combination of two separate and false rumors that we have already debunked at length: that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon, and that Soros owns the laboratory in Wuhan where the alleged development of the virus supposedly took place. The rumor that \u201cIndia is suing Bill Gates because he vaccinated 77,000 third world girls between the ages of 9 &amp; 15 and many of them died\u201d is also a false one that we have explored at length. This claim is not directly connected to Gates or the Gates Foundation, but rather to the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), which conducted a study beginning in 2009 to see if it could reduce the number of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. (The Gates Foundation was one of PATH\u2019s global partners and reportedly provided funding for its HPV study.) The study caused controversy in India when seven of the girls involved in the trial in that country died after receiving their vaccines, but state investigations found those deaths were unrelated to the vaccinations: State investigations absolved the trial\u2019s managers \u2014 PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi \u2014 of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \u201cunlikely.\u201d ICMR\u2019s director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \u201cBased on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\u201d he insists. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suspended PATH\u2019s HPV clinical trial in India over irregularities such as improperly obtained consent forms, and the Union Government issued a warning letter to PATH \u201casking it to be careful while conducting clinical trials so as to ensure that discrepancies and violations are not repeated in future.\u201d But neither that global health organization nor the Gates Foundation is being \u201csued\u201d by India or has been \u201cbanned\u201d from operating in that country.

    "content": " Claim:   Thomas Jefferson warned about the dangers of governmental interference in medical care.  FALSE  Example:   [Collected via e-mail, June  2012]        A quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson is being circulated in response to Obama\u2019s healthcare law. Is this really him and in what context did he say it? \u201cIf the people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in a sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny.\u201d \u2013 Thomas Jefferson      Origins:   Notes on the State of Virginia was the only full-length book by Thomas Jefferson which was published during his lifetime.  Initially finished in 1781 (with additional updates in 1782 and 1783), the book was presented in a format which had Jefferson responding to questions about Virginia which had been posed to him in 1780 by Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois, the Secretary of the French delegation at Philadelphia.  The completed work was first published anonymously in Paris in 1785; the first English edition appeared in London in 1787.  In response to a question about the various religious groups that had made their way into Virginia, Jefferson wrote:  The error seems not sufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are subject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over such natural rights only as we have submitted to them. The rights of conscience we never submitted, we could not submit. We are answerable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be said, his testimony in a court of justice cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the stigma on him. Constraint may make him worse by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him obstinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Reason and free enquiry are the only effectual agents against error. Give a loose to them, they will support the true religion, by bringing every false one to their tribunal, to the test of their investigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, Christianity could never have been introduced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the era of the reformation, the corruptions of Christianity could not have been purged away. If it be restrained now, the present corruptions will be protected, and new ones encouraged. Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potatoe as an article of food.            Since the late 1990s, the sentence highlighted above has been transformed into the statement \u201cIf the people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in a sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny\u201d and proffered as a Founding Father\u2019s sagacious warning across the centuries about the dangers of government-run health care.  But that isn\u2019t what Jefferson wrote, nor is it what he meant.   Jefferson wasn\u2019t cautioning against the government\u2019s meddling with private medical practice and likening it to tyranny; he was suggesting that legislating morality was as futile as legislating what a person might swallow. His larger point was that we are the keepers of our own souls (in the sense of being free to practice whichever religion we choose), and the that state has no more right to govern our souls than it has to govern our bodies (by, for example, choosing our medicines and diets for us).

    "claim": "An American diplomat named Melanie Honcharenko was found dead shortly before testifying in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump. ",
    "content": " On Dec. 4, 2019, the White House Insider published an article claiming that \u201cAmerican diplomat Melanie Honcharenko\u201d was found dead in her home shortly before testifying in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump: American Diplomat Melanie Honcharenko was discovered dead in her North Potomac, MD home early Wednesday morning. No details are known at the moment; Maryland authorities have yet to make a statement of any kind.  What is known is that Honcharenko has played an active diplomatic role in Ukraine since 2016, and was an active participant in a number of the incidents described by the witnesses in the Impeachment proceedings of President Donald Trump, and was set to be deposed behind closed doors sometime next week due to the classified nature of her work in Ukraine. This is not a genuine news article, and an American diplomat by that name was not found dead in her home shortly before testifying in the impeachment inquiry into Trump.  First, we were unable to find any record of an American diplomat by this name. In fact, we were unable to find any person with this name prior to the publication of White House Insider article. Furthermore, a woman by the name Melanie Honcharenko was never scheduled to deliver testimony during the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The House Intelligence Committee announced the witnesses who would publicly testify in November 2019. The witnesses scheduled to appear before the House Judiciary Committee were announced in early December 2019. The name \u201cHoncharenko\u201d appeared on no lists.  We also performed a reverse-image search on the photograph that White House Insider claimed showed Honcharenko. We found that the person featured in this image was actually a professor at the University of Alberta named Alla Nedashkivska.  In short, the White House Insider article took a photograph of an unrelated woman, invented the name of American diplomat, and then claimed without evidence that she was found dead in her home before testifying in Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.

    "content": " Claim:   One of the top search results in Google for the word \u201cjew\u201d points to an anti-Semitic site.   Status:   True.  Example:   [Collected on the Internet, 2004]    Upon reading in the Jewish Press that an anti-Semitic website is the first result one gets when typing in the word \u201cJew\u201d on Google, the Internet\u2019s number one search engine, I contacted Google and basically got a run-around. I was told that in order for Google to rectify the problem, I would need some sort of petition with at least 50,000 names. I\u2019ve taken Google at its word and have set up an online petition for people to sign \u2014 at: www.removejewwatch.com \u2014 and express their concern and disapproval.  I hope you readers will help us come closer to realizing our goal. Steven M. Weinstock          Origins:   Their ability to comb the Internet places the power of fast and easy acquisition of information into our hands, but search engines also have the potential of herding information-seekers towards a few specific web pages via their ranking systems.  Sites that appear high in those rankings \u2014 on the first page of search results, say, or within the top three to five entries \u2014 garner far more traffic than do similar web destinations that appear lower in the standings. For this reason, those first few spots in the rankings are considered key and are heavily  prized. Unfortunately, in the case of the word \u201cjew,\u201d that prize is currently going to an unsavory entity. On 13 April 2004, The New York Times reported that the first listed site on a Google search for \u201cJew\u201d was Jewwatch.com, an online venue that proclaims itself as \u201cKeeping a close watch on Jewish communities &amp; organizations worldwide\u201d and offers references to anti-Semitic research, documents, and organizations. Although the removejewwatch.com web site mentioned in the widely circulated e-mail quoted above was a real site and did indeed house an earnestly-intended petition aimed at getting Google to drop JewWatch.com from its search results, the search service does not appear to have been swayed by it and has indicated it has no plans to remove the objectionable site from its list of indexed web sites (nor does Google have a stated policy of altering its search results upon receipt of 50,000-signature petitions):  \u201cWe find this result offensive, but the objectivity of our ranking function prevents us from making any changes,\u201d said David Krane, a Google spokesman. Google makes exceptions to this hands-off policy only in instances where the content of a site is illegal (e.g. child pornography, pedophilia forums). The search engine giant has been returning Jewwatch.com as its number one result for the word \u201cjew\u201d since 2001 (the rankings are volatile and can change several times a day; sometimes other pages temporarily occupy the top spot), but this ordering appears to have escaped widespread notice until a 19 February 2004 Jerusalem Post article made passing mention of it:   Surely [Rabbi Daniel] Lapin agrees that there is still plenty of anti-Semitism to combat even in the US, as one who simply googles the word \u2018Jew\u2019 will discover (the very first website that pops up is \u2018Jewwatch \u2014 keeping an eye on Jewish terrorists, Jewish atrocities, and Jewish banking and financial manipulations.\u2019)         The offense has been going on for years; only the hue and cry is new. As right as it initially might seem for Google to remove JewWatch.com from its listings, to do so would mean this very respected search service would have to put at risk its reliability by engaging in censorship on a subjective basis (rather than excluding sites based on the objective criterion of illegality). Few sites are so innocuous as to bar disgruntled persons from starting movements to exclude them from search engine rankings, and once Google has acquiesced to one such pressuring, it would inevitably be viewed as \u201cunfair\u201d for not giving in to many of the other similar movements that would surely come.  (Thousands of web sites on the Internet include anti-Semitic material \u2014 is Google expected to track down and filter out every single one of them, or is Google supposed to, in effect, single out and punish one particular site for the offense of being popular?) Google stands by its assessment that its numbers justify assigning JewWatch a high ranking in its search results for the word \u201cjew.\u201d Different search engines derive their results in different ways, but Google, the most popular search engine, orders the results it presents on the basis of how many other sites link to a page or web site.   In general, the more and better those links are, the higher the matches for the linked site will appear in Google\u2019s search results. (The quality of the sites linking to the looked-for terms are factored in, as explained in Google\u2019s article about page rank.)   For now at least, Google has chosen not to cave in to the demand. By taking this path, this most popular of online services has chosen to risk a measure of unpopularity for the sake of continued reliability rather than gambling on the often fickle nature of human gratitude.

    "claim": "A photograph shows U.S. President Bill Clinton with billionaire/financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ",
    "content": " On July 10, 2019, we examined a claim holding that Google was \u201cscrubbing\u201d its search results of any pictures showing President Bill Clinton together with convicted sex offender and billionaire/financier Jeffrey Epstein. While this rumor was false (Google\u2019s search results were not notably different than those of Yahoo, Duck Duck Go, Yandex, or Bing), we were left with one unanswered question: Are there any photos of Epstein and Clinton? After all, Clinton flew on the private plane of Epstein, a convicted sex offender who was arrested again in July 2019 on new charges related to child-sex-prostitution. The two were also both present at a \u201csmall dinner party\u201d in 1995 hosted by Revlon mogul Ron Perelman to raise funds for the Democratic National Convention. It seems reasonable to believe that someone at some point took a photograph of these two well-known public figures together.  On July 22, 2019, Josh Rosner, the managing director of independent research consultancy Graham Fisher &amp; Co, alerted us to his tweet containing a photograph of Epstein and Clinton that was published in a 2003 issue of Vanity Fair:  Disturbing! The #press wiped all pictures of \u2066@BillClinton\u2069 &amp; #JeffreyEpstein from the #internet. Even \u2066@VanityFair\u2069 who published this image in \u201803 from their #sex(?) trip to Brunei scrubbed it. #sycophant #power \u2066@CJR\u2069 \u2066@theintercept\u2069 \u2066@propublica\u2069 pic.twitter.com/MmCZZraHai \u2014 joshua rosner (@JoshRosner) July 22, 2019        Again, no evidence exists that this image was \u201cwiped\u201d from the Internet. In fact, this image is available online in Vanity Fair\u2019s digital archive (subscription required). This photograph was published in a March 2003 article by Vicky Ward entitled, \u201cThe Talented Mr. Epstein.\u201d The photograph\u2019s caption: \u201cEpstein with President Clinton in Brunei, 2002.\u201d  One possible explanation as to why this photograph doesn\u2019t pop up in search engines is that Vanity Fair didn\u2019t publish it as a standalone image. Rather, it is embedded in a digital copy of the March 2003 edition of the magazine. While we\u2019re not in the business of offering predictions, we\u2019d bet that this image will start finding its way into Google Images and other image-based search engines in the near future (especially if more outlets pick up and publish stories including this image). Clinton is mentioned three other times in the Vanity Fair story; each iteration is reproduced below (emphasis ours): Lately, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s high-flying style has been drawing oohs and aahs: the bachelor financier lives in New York\u2019s largest private residence, claims to take only billionaires as clients, and flies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD explores Epstein\u2019s investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past.  In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named \u201cZorro.\u201d \u201cIt makes the town house look like a shack,\u201d Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Aman resorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman\u2019s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.  Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women\u2014lots of them, mostly young. Model types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he is a familiar face to many of the Victoria\u2019s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein\u2019s town house, where the women seemed to outnumber the men by far. \u201cThese were not women you\u2019d see at Upper East Side dinners,\u201d the woman recalls. \u201cMany seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.\u201d This same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was filled, she says, with young Russian models. \u201cSome of the guests were horrified,\u201d the woman says. \u201cHe\u2019s reckless,\u201d says a former business associate, \u201cand he\u2019s gotten more so. Money does that to you. He\u2019s breaking the oath he made to himself\u2014that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton, he must be in a very difficult place.\u201d In 2002, around the time that this photograph was taken, Clinton told New York Magazine via a spokesperson that, \u201cJeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service and combating H.I.V./AIDS.\u201d Clinton once had a relationship with Epstein and even took multiple trips on his private plane. However, the former president said that he hasn\u2019t had contact with Epstein for a decade and knows nothing about the crimes the latter has been accused or convicted of:  Statement on Jeffrey Epstein. pic.twitter.com/98ha9YYd1l \u2014 Angel Ure\u00f1a (@angelurena) July 8, 2019  Clinton, of course, isn\u2019t the only high-profile politician connected to Epstein. U.S. President Donald Trump has also been photographed with Epstein.  ",

    "content": " On 15 January 2017, the Argentinian news site Nuevo Diario, among others, published an article with the (translated) headline \u201cStudy Confirms That Chubby Women Make a Man Happier Than a Skinny Woman.\u201d That story was picked up by a number of English language sites, including  \u201cThe Laugh Bible\u201d:  New research: Men who marry chubby women are happier and live longer According to a new study, men who are in relationships with chubby women tend to smile more and be better at dealing with problems than men who are in relationships with thin women. The study also shows that thin women tend to be more reserved, more unfriendly and less expressive with their emotions. The Argentinian newspaper Nuevo Diario reports on the findings from the research conducted by Dr Filem\u00f3n Alvarado and Dr Edgardo Morales at UNAM\u2019s department of psychology. According to their research, chubby women make their men ten times as happy as thin women. And we all know that happy people live longer. The study also indicated that chubby women are better at anticipating their partner\u2019s needs.  In terms of science journalism, a number of red flags were apparent right off the bat. The easiest to spot would be the fact that not a single news report on this topic provided a link to the \u201cnew study\u201d it referenced. Second, and perhaps more damning, is the fact that a quick Google Scholar search provides no evidence that anybody named Filem\u00f3n Alvarado or Edgardo Morales ever published anything remotely approaching this topic over at least the past two years. Third, a regular Google search on their names provides only links related to this one viral story. Additionally, the web site of the psychology department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (option one for UNAM) does not list someone by either name as a faculty member,  and the web site for the National University of Misiones in Argentina (option two for UNAM) provides no evidence that the school has a psychology department at all. The final documentable red flag is the fact that the alleged study (a thesis reportedly titled \u201cVale m\u00e1s que sobre y que no falte\u201d) does not turn up in a search of either institutions\u2019 web sites. While we are not rating the claims of the study itself, we are rating its existence as unproven for the above reasons. We have reached out to both UNAMs and will update if either institution is able clarify the confusion. ",
