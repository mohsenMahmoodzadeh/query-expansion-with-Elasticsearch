MIXTURE OF TRUE AND FALSE INFORMATION  Examples:         [Collected on the Internet, 2005] LIFE WITHOUT BLACK PEOPLE A very humorous and revealing story is told about a group of white people who were fed up with African Americans, so they joined together and wished themselves away. They passed through a deep dark tunnel and emerged in sort of a twilight zone where there is an America without black people. At first these white people breathed a sigh of relief. At last, they said, \u201cNo more crime, drugs, violence and welfare. All of the blacks have gone!\u201d Then suddenly, reality set in. The \u201cNEW AMERICA\u201d is not America at all \u2014 only a barren land. 1. There are very few crops that have flourished because the nation was built on a slave-supported system. 2. There are no cities with tall skyscrapers because Alexander Mils, a black man, invented the elevator, and without it, one finds great difficulty reaching higher floors. 3. There are few if any cars because Richard Spikes, a black man, invented the automatic gearshift, Joseph Gambol, also black, invented the Super Charge System for Internal Combustion Engines, and Garrett A. Morgan, a black man, invented the traffic signals. 4. Furthermore, one could not use the rapid transit system because its procurer was the electric trolley, which was invented by another black man, Albert R. Robinson. 5. Even if there were streets on which cars and a rapid transit system could operate, they were cluttered with paper because an African American, Charles Brooks, invented the street sweeper. 6. There were few if any newspapers, magazines and books because John Love invented the pencil sharpener, William Purveys invented the fountain pen, and Lee Barrage invented the Type Writing Machine and W. A. Love invented the Advanced Printing Press. They were all, you guessed it, Black. 7. Even if Americans could write their letters, articles and books, they would not have been transported by mail because William Barry invented the Postmarking and Canceling Machine, William Purveys invented the Hand Stamp and Philip Downing invented the Letter Drop. 8. The lawns were brown and wilted because Joseph Smith invented the Lawn Sprinkler and John Burr the Lawn Mower. 9. When they entered their homes, they found them to be poorly ventilated and poorly heated. You see, Frederick Jones invented the Air Conditioner and Alice Parker the Heating Furnace. Their homes were also dim. But of course, Lewis Later invented the Electric Lamp, Michael Harvey invented the lantern and Granville T. Woods invented the Automatic Cut off Switch. Their homes were also filthy because Thomas W. Steward invented the Mop and Lloyd P. Ray the Dust Pan. 10. Their children met them at the door-barefooted, shabby, motley and unkempt. But what could one expect? Jan E. Matzelinger invented the Shoe Lasting Machine, Walter Sammons invented the Comb, Sarah Boone invented the Ironing Board and George T. Samon invented the Clothes Dryer. 11. Finally, they were resigned to at least have dinner amidst all of this turmoil. But here again, the food had spoiled because another Black Man, John Standard invented the refrigerator. Now, isn\u2019t that something? What would this country be like without the contributions of Blacks, as African-Americans? Martin Luther King, Jr. said, \u201cby the time we leave for work, Americans have depended on the inventions from the minds of Blacks.\u201d Black history includes more than just slavery, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois. PLEASE SHARE, ABUNDANTLY     [Collected on the Internet, 1999] This is a story of a little boy name Theo who woke up one morning and asked his mother, \u201cMom, what if there were no Black people in the world?\u201d Well his mother thought about that for a moment, and then said \u201cSon, follow me around today and lets just see what it would be like if there were no Black people in the world.\u201d Mom said, \u201cNow go get dressed and we will get started.\u201d Theo ran to his room to put on his clothes and shoes. His mother took one look at him and said \u201cTheo, where are your shoes, and those clothes are all wrinkled son, I must iron them.\u201d But when she reached for the ironing board it was no longer there.  You see Sarah Boone, a black woman, invented the ironing board and Jan E. Matzelinger, a black man, invented the shoe lasting machine. \u201cOh well,\u201d she said, \u201cplease go and do something to your hair.\u201d  Theo ran in his room to comb his hair, but the comb was not there.  You see, Walter Sammons, a black man, invented the comb.  Theo decided to just brush his hair, but the brush was gone.  You see Lydia O. Newman, a black female, invented the brush. Well this was a sight, no shoes, wrinkled clothes, hair a mess, even Moms hair, without the hair care inventions of Madam C.J. Walker,  well you get the picture. Mom told Theo, \u201clets do our chores around the house and then take a trip to the grocery store.\u201d  Theo\u2019s job was to sweep the floor.  He swept and swept and swept.  When he reached for the dust pan, it was not there.  You see, Lloyd P. Ray, a black man, invented the dust pan.  So he swept his pile of dirt over in the corner and left it there.  He then decided to mop the floor, but the mop was gone. You see, Thomas W. Stewart, a black man, invented the mop.  Theo yelled to his Mom, \u201cMom, I\u2019m not having any luck.\u201d \u201cWell son,\u201d she said, \u201clet me finish washing these clothes and we will prepare a list for the grocery store.\u201d  When the wash finished, she went to place the clothes in the dryer but it was not there.  You see, George T. Samon, a black man, invented the clothes dryer. Mom asked Theo to go get a pencil and some paper to prepare their list for the market.  So Theo ran for the paper and pencil but noticed the pencil lead was broken. Well he was out of luck because John Love, a black man, invented the pencil sharpener. Mom reached for a pen, but it was not there because William Purvis, a black man, invented the fountain pen.  As a matter of fact, Lee Burridge invented the type writing machine, and W. A. Lovette the advanced printing press. Theo and his mother decided to head out to the market. Well when Theo opened the door he noticed the grass was as high as he was tall.  You see, the lawn mower was invented by John Burr, a black man. They made their way over to the car and found that it just wouldn\u2019t go.  You see, Richard Spikes, a black man, invented the automatic gear shift and Joseph Gammel invented the supercharge system for internal combustion engines.  They noticed that the few cars that were moving were running into each other and having wrecks because there were no traffic signals.  You see, Garrett A. Morgan, a black man invented the traffic light. Well, it was getting late, so they walked to the market, got their groceries and returned home.  Just when they were about to put away the milk, eggs and butter, they noticed the refrigerator was gone.  You see John Standard, a black man, invented the refrigerator.  So they just left the food on the counter. By this time, Theo noticed he was getting mighty cold. Mom went to turn up the heat, and what do you know. Alice Parker, a black female, invented the heating furnace. Even in the summer time they would have been out of luck because Frederick Jones, a black man, invented the air conditioner.  It was almost time for Theo\u2019s father to arrive home.  He takes the bus.  But there was no bus, because it\u2019s precursor was the electric trolley, invented by another black man, Elbert R. Robinson. He usually takes the elevator from his office on the 20th floor, but there was no elevator because Alexander Miles, a black man, invented the elevator.  He also usually dropped off the office mail at a near by mailbox, but it was no longer there because Philip Downing, a black man, invented the letter drop mailbox and William Barry invented the postmarking and canceling machine. Theo and his mother sat at the kitchen table with their heads in their hands.  When the father arrived he asked, \u201cWhy are you sitting in the dark?\u201d  Why? Because Lewis Howard Latimer, a black man, invented the filament within the light bulb.  Theo quickly learned what it would be like if there were no black people in the world. Not to mention if he were ever sick and needed blood. Charles Drew, a black scientist, found a way to preserve and store blood, which led to his starting the worlds first blood bank.  And what if a family member had to have heart surgery?  This would not have been possible without Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, a black doctor, who performed the first open heart surgery. So if you ever wonder, like Theo, where would we be without black people?  Well, it\u2019s pretty plain to see. We would still be in the DARK!!!!  IF YOU GAINED ANY INSIGHT FROM THIS PLEASE PASS IT ON      Variations:   Another version also in circulation in 1999 presented the discussion thusly, instead of positioning it as an experience shared by Theo and his mother, as in the second example above:   This is a story of a little boy named Uchechi, who woke up one morning and asked God, \u201cWhat if there were no Black people in the world?\u201d  Well, God thought about that for a moment and then said, \u201cSon, follow me around today and let\u2019s just see what it would be like if there were no Black people in the world. Get dressed and we will get started.\u201d   Origins:   We have been encountering this particular bit of online lore since 1997. Variously titled \u201cA World         Without Black People,\u201d \u201cBlack Inventors and Inventions,\u201d \u201cAmerica Without Black People,\u201d and \u201cBlack History Facts,\u201d the piece has remained remarkably unchanged in that time. With the exception of its preface, the list that turns up in inboxes today is almost a carbon copy of that found in the earliest versions. This summary of innovators and their creations is hard to classify as \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d for a number of reasons. First, it is flawed in its premise that if these African-American pioneers of manufacturing had not crafted the things they created, those items would never have been invented. Innovation does not wait upon particular inventors.   If a sudden brainstorm is not experienced by one person, it will be visited upon another, as evidenced by the number of times in history where two or more people simultaneously conceived the same great idea and thereafter raced to patent and bring it to market first. Second, the list is a mix of both accuracy and inaccuracy, even within single entries where fact and error cozy up against one another. While this compendium does outline a number of valid accomplishments, in many of the items the claims being advanced are overblown, crediting particular African-Americans with the invention of items for which they only crafted specific improvements. For example, Alexander Miles did not invent the elevator: that device was around long before he came on the scene, but he did devise an improved mechanism that governed the opening and closing of its doors, and he fashioned a key safety feature that automatically shut doors to the shaft when the car was on another floor, thereby keeping the muddle-headed from wandering into open shafts and thence their  deaths. Third, further clogging the assessment process is the realization that very few products can be said to have been the brainchild of just one person. Invention is largely the process of building on the technologies devised or improved by others, turning them to new purposes or using them in different ways. Therefore, many technologies don\u2019t really have definable start points \u2014 for instance, one would be hard pressed to name the inventor of the automobile.  The automobile came into being through a process of gradual evolution rather arrived on the scene in completed form, in that as the components and design of self-propelled vehicles were reworked and refined, what would eventually become the automobile grew ever closer to being recognizable as the contraption we now know it as.  There is no one definable moment in the automobile\u2019s history which one could without just fear of contradiction point to and say \u201cHere is where it began.\u201d  In many instances, the people who get credit for \u201cinventing\u201d technologies are the ones who come up with the key steps that make them commercially viable or are the first to successfully market them, even though many, many other minds were involved in the process. Given that there is no easy, short answer to the \u201cIs it true?\u201d question posed by those who receive this list and are left wondering about the claims made in the e-mailed summary of achievements, we\u2019ll have to go at it the long way.    1. There are very few crops that have flourished because the nation was built on a slave-supported system.   Almost the opposite is true: with the exception of cotton and tobacco, which are labor-intensive crops throughout their growing processes and so require an ever-present workforce to raise, just about every major U.S. crop would have proved economically unfeasible under a slave-supported agrarian system. Crops such as wheat and corn require vast amounts of labor at the planting and harvesting stages, but precious little attention in between. Consequently, in pre-mechanized days, growers of just about anything that wasn\u2019t cotton or tobacco would have faced financial ruin if they\u2019d opted to keep slaves rather than hire extra hands for those two short but widely-separated intensive bursts of activity. Slaves had to be fed, housed, clothed, and medicated year round; they would have represented a constant and substantial financial drain on farmers who tried to use them as their workforce.         2. There are no cities with tall skyscrapers because Alexander Mils, a black man, invented the elevator, and without it, one finds great difficulty reaching higher floors.   As mentioned above, Alexander Miles (not Mils) did not invent the elevator.   He devised certain improvements in elevator technology, and even those improvements had nothing to do with moving the cars up and down, which at least would have been a bit more in resonance with the \u201cinvented the elevator\u201d claim. His contributions to elevator technology had to do with their doors.   3. There are few if any cars because Richard Spikes, a black man, invented the automatic gearshift, Joseph Gambol, also black, invented the Super Charge System for Internal Combustion Engines, and Garrett A. Morgan, a black man, invented the traffic signals.   Richard Spikes crafted an improved automatic gear shift in 1932, but he did not invent this bit of technology.  We\u2019ve so far been unable to locate any information about Joseph Gambol (or Gammel; we\u2019ve seen it spelled both ways) or the \u201cSuper Charge System for Internal Combustion Engines,\u201d and so at the moment we can\u2019t offer any insight into this entry. Garrett A. Morgan did invent the automated traffic signal in 1923, but the first known traffic signal was designed in 1868 by J.P. Knight in England. Morgan sold the rights to his patent to General Electric for $40,000, which was an astonishing sum back in those days.   4. Furthermore, one could not use the rapid transit system because its procurer was the electric trolley, which was invented by another black man, Albert R. Robinson.   Elbert (not Albert) R. Robinson invented an electric railway trolley in 1893. We\u2019re not sure, however, if his was the first invention of its kind.         5. Even if there were streets on which cars and a rapid transit system could operate, they were cluttered with paper because an African American, Charles Brooks, invented the street sweeper.   In 1896 Charles Brooks devised improvements to street sweeper trucks, but not the vehicles themselves. His was a refinement of existing technology, not an invention of the technology itself.   6. There were few if any newspapers, magazines and books because John Love invented the pencil sharpener, William Purveys invented the fountain pen, and Lee Barrage invented the Type Writing Machine and W. A. Love invented the Advanced Printing Press. They were all, you guessed it, Black.   In 1897 John Lee Love invented a simple, portable pencil sharpener he dubbed the \u201cLove Sharpener.\u201d Yet it was not the first implement of this nature: the manual pencil sharpener was invented in 1847 by Therry des Estwaux and was at least conceived of in 1828, the year a Frenchman named Bernard Lassimone applied for a patent on one. William B. Purvis (not Purveys) patented a number of improvements to the fountain pen in 1890, but fountain pens themselves had been around since 1809. Lee Burridge (not Barrage) fashioned a number of typewriter improvements, but he did not invent the typewriter \u2014 the first patent for such a machine was issued in 1868 to Christopher Latham Sholes. Finding information about W. A. Love has also so far proved difficult. However, he certainly didn\u2019t invent the printing press; the first of those was used in 1450 by Johannes Gutenberg.   7. Even if Americans could write their letters, articles and books, they would not have been transported by mail because William Barry invented the Postmarking and Canceling Machine, William Purveys invented the Hand Stamp and Philip Downing invented the Letter Drop.   William Barry invented a postmarking and canceling machine in 1897, but the first of that sort of contraption was created in England in 1857 by Pearson Hill. Philip Downing did invent a particular kind of letter drop mailbox in 1891, but such boxes had been around at least since 1858. William Purvis (not Purveys) did design a self-inking hand stamp in 1883, but the first postal handstamp is credited to Henry Bishop, Postmaster General of Great Britain, in the year 1661.    8. The lawns were brown and wilted because Joseph Smith invented the Lawn Sprinkler and John Burr the Lawn Mower.   Joseph Smith did indeed patent the swiveling lawn sprinkler in 1897; however, its companion in this entry does not fare as well. While it is true that in 1899 John Albert Burr did devise an improved rotary blade lawn mower, the patent for a \u201cmachine for mowing lawns, etc.\u201d dates to 1830, to a British engineer named Edwin Beard Budding.   9. When they entered their homes, they found them to be poorly ventilated and poorly heated. You see, Frederick Jones invented the Air Conditioner and Alice Parker the Heating Furnace. Their homes were also dim. But of course, Lewis Later invented the Electric Lamp, Michael Harvey invented the lantern and Granville T. Woods invented the Automatic Cut off Switch. Their homes were also filthy because Thomas W. Steward invented the Mop and Lloyd P. Ray the Dust Pan.   Frederick McKinley Jones did not invent the air conditioner (that honor properly belongs to Willis Carrier, who patented it in 1902), but he did design the portable air conditioning unit used at military field hospitals in World War II. It allowed the military to store perishable life-saving medicines and blood serum close to the battlefield, even in the Pacific theater of operations where temperatures and humidity would otherwise have made short work of such products, and thus of the men dependent on receiving them. Furnaces have been around for thousands of years, dating back at least as far as to the Romans. While Alice Parker did in 1919 secure a patent on a furnace, hers was far from the first: by 1888, more than 4,000 patents on heating stoves and furnaces had been granted in the U.S. In 1882 Lewis Howard Latimer (not Later) did indeed invent a method of making carbon filaments for the Maxim electric incandescent lamp, but he did not invent the lightbulb itself.  Michael Harvey is another of those names we\u2019re having trouble locating information on, but we can safely say he didn\u2019t invent the lantern, as those devices had been around for centuries, if not millennia. Granville T. Woods did in 1889 invent an automatic safety cut-out for electric circuits, but we\u2019re not sure if his was the first of its kind.  In 1893 Thomas W. Stewart (not Steward) crafted a self-wringing form of mop, but did not invent the mop itself. In 1897 Lloyd P. Ray invented not the dust pan, but the long-handled dust pan, a device that allowed the sweeper to not have to bend over to hold the pan to the floor so as to collect the sweepings.   10. Their children met them at the door-barefooted, shabby, motley and unkempt. But what could one expect? Jan E. Matzelinger invented the Shoe Lasting Machine, Walter Sammons invented the Comb, Sarah Boone invented the Ironing Board and George T. Samon invented the Clothes Dryer.   In 1883 Jan Ernst Matzeliger (not Matzelinger) did indeed come up with an original innovation that changed how a particular item was made: he devised a machine that would sew the sole to the upper of a shoe in about a minute. His \u201cshoe lasting\u201d machine changed the process of how shoes were made by mechanizing a part of their manufacture that previously had to be done by hand and thereby cut the cost of making shoes by half. Combs have been around about as long as humans have; archaeologists are hard-pressed to find a burial mound or grave of any age that doesn\u2019t contain them. Walter Sammons invented a heated comb, a device to help with the straightening of hair. In 1892 Sarah Boone invented an improvement to the ironing board, not the board itself. Her brainchild was a curved narrow board that allowed for the sleeves of ladies\u2019 garments to be stretched over it. George T. Sampson (not Samon) was indeed granted the first U.S. patent for a clothes dryer, in 1892.   11. Finally, they were resigned to at least have dinner amidst all of this turmoil. But here again, the food had spoiled because another Black Man, John Standard invented the refrigerator.   In 1891 John Standard came up with an improvement to the refrigerator, but not the refrigerator itself, which was first patented in Scotland in 1748 by William Cullen.  In researching all these items, we could not help but conclude that someone\u2019s zeal to praise black inventors instead potentially set up these innovators for ridicule. While only a small percentage of the general population has more than a smattering of knowledge about the histories of various products, that smattering is enough for the rest of us to realize that claims of a particular person\u2019s having invented the comb are ludicrous \u2014 a moment\u2019s thought about how long those implements have been around quickly reveals that assertion as farcical. (The same could be said of claims about the invention of the dust pan or the mop, although those assertions are slightly less obvious in their ludicrosity.) And with the \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding\u201d dismissal of any one item comes the danger of a \u201cYeah, right\u201d response to all the rest, the one bad item having poisoned perception of the others.  Those who push past that set-back to do a little delving into some of the compendium\u2019s other trumpetings are quickly brought to the realization that this summary of African-American achievement time and again flat-out states that so-and-so \u201cinvented\u201d a common item when history shows that person only crafted an improvement to a particular piece of technology, making his or her contribution on par with that of any number of non-African-American inventors that no one other than business scholars now has any awareness of. One who gets that far into the research process is likely to be left asking \u201cIs this the best that can be said of African-American inventors, that almost all of their contributions amounted to no more than small improvements to already existing technologies? Does the puffery inherent to this summary mean there was nothing substantial to celebrate, else the list would provide details of those in preference to making the wild overstatements it does?\u201d Which brings us to the twin sadnesses of the matter: the list serves to obscure African-American contributions that should have been celebrated  by shifting attention to items that were not nearly as vital, and makes black men and women who invented great things appear trivial by highlighting only their lesser innovations. For example, you have Richard Spikes (of the improved automatic gear shift discussed above) to thank for your car\u2019s turn signals.  He invented automatic directional lights, which were first installed on a Pierce Arrow automobile in 1913. In 1935 Frederick McKinley Jones (of the portable air conditioning unit) invented the first refrigerated truck. He kept tinkering at his innovation, eventually developing a highly successful automatic refrigeration system for long-haul carriers. Prior to Jones\u2019 invention, many people were primarily limited to eating foods grown locally, because perishable goods could not be efficiently transported over longer distances. Percy Julian came up with a soy protein concoction that put out gas and oil fires not extinguishable by water. This material, known as \u201cbean soup\u201d aboard U.S. Navy ships, saved the lives of countless sailors during World War II. That same man, Percy Julian, came up with a way to synthesize cortisone, a sterol that has eased the sufferings of millions. Prior to his work, sterols cost several hundreds of dollars per gram; his process brought that cost down to 20 cents per gram. Even the relatively minor innovations to existing technologies for which the African-Americans listed above were responsible are important and vital in their own way, of course, but the \u201cLIFE WITHOUT BLACK PEOPLE\u201d piece misses its target due to too many inaccuracies and trivialities.  There is much to laud in the roll call of black inventors, and someone should do them better service than the above-quoted article does.

    "claim": "A rare black rose grows naturally in Turkey.",
    "content": " On 25 May 2016, the Facebook page Higher Perspective published the above video purportedly showing a rare black rose that grows naturally in Turkey. Higher Perspective was not the first entity to make this claim. This rumor has been circulating since at least 2013, when RocketNews24 published a story about a rare black rose:  Until now, we never really understood what all the fuss was about roses. Women seem to love them, and men seem to spend inordinate amounts of money to purchase them for their sweethearts. But now that we\u2019ve seen the pitch-black Turkish Halfeti Rose, we\u2019re starting to understand that roses can be not only dangerous, kind of smelly and enchanting all at the same time, they can also be the perfect centerpiece of the most hardcore heavy metal album or low fantasy book cover of all time. These roses, which appear perfectly black to the naked eye, are said to grow only in small quantities and only in the tiny village of Halfeti, Turkey. The unique soil conditions and pH levels of groundwater in the area \u2013 which seeps in from the Euphrates \u2013 create the deep crimson red color of the rose, which is, for all intents and purposes, solid black unless inspected very closely. The origin of the black rose story followed a daisy chain of misinformation. RocketNews24 cited the Japanese-language blog Karapaia, which in turn cited a 2007 story published by Todays Zaman, which was reportedly based off a local news article published in Anatolia. Somewhere during the process, the rumor that black roses occur naturally in Turkey was born.  Yet we found no evidence of black roses growing naturally in Turkey or any other part of the world. While very dark red roses (which can appear almost black) do grow in nature, the photographs featured in the Higher Perspective video, as well as the ones included in the Rocket News article, were either digitally manipulated or featured dyed roses: The only thing close to a black rose are the very dark red roses referred to as Black Magic Roses or Bacarra Roses.  There is no such thing as a real black rose that Mother Nature has produced.  However roses can be tinted black to give a black color appearance.       For instance, the first rose featured in the Higher Perspective video was digitally darkened:  It should also be noted that many of these photographs were not associated with the claim that they were grown in Turkey until they were included in the RocketNews24 article published in 2013. When Todays Zaman published their article about the alleged \u201cblack rose,\u201d they included a photograph of a dark red flower:  It is possible that there is a type of flower with extremely dark coloring that\u2019s native to Turkey, but if it does exist, it\u2019s not shown in these photographs.

    "content": " Claim:   Article reproduces Florida Congressman Allen West\u2019s comments about Black History Month.  FALSE  Example:   [Collected via e-mail, February 2012]        Did Cong. Allen West actually say the following? I can\u2019t find anything on CNN that confirms this. In a week of circus like activity for the GOP, Republican Congressman Allen West may have taken the award for the most over the top statement ever given. In a recent sit down with the Florida Representative, CNN anchor John King asked Mr. West how he felt about being a black Congressman during Black History Month.  In light of this month being Black History Month, I feel no way involved with this negro celebration of half accomplishments and borderline Communist agendas. View the list of these \u201cfearless\u201d leaders of black America. Black inhabitants of America knew their place at the table, and knew they could not eat off the same plate of the more than welcoming white men and women of the time. These men, I use that term lightly, like Malcolm X pushed themselves into the homes of innocent white Americans. This action riled up the negro, and scared the living hell out of people. I am no way apart of this community of transported Africans, I myself am an American. I\u2019m a good ol\u2019 boy from the great state of Florida, and a citizen of this great nation. I know God recognizes me as my true self, a proud, strong white man given dark pigmentation. God had to give the blacks at least one intelligent person, so he chose to give me dark skin. I curse my birth as a black man every day. I\u2019m black by birth, not by choice. It will all be sorted out when my name is called, and I step in front of the great white Jesus himself.  In outrage, many black organizations and churches took to the internet. The NAACP posted a Tweet saying \u201cMr. West is entitled to his own opinion, no matter how outrageous it is.\u201d Many black Americans feel that Mr. West should be removed from his position according to a recent Yahoo! poll           Origins:   Allen West represents Florida\u2019s 22nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives; his election to that body in 2010 made him the first black Republican Congressman from Florida since a former slave served two terms in House in the 1870s. The comments attributed to Rep. West above, supposedly made by him in response to a question about Black History Month during a CNN interview in February 2012, are not words he actually uttered.  They were taken from a spoof article published on the satirical web site Free Wood Post, which describes itself as offering \u201cNews that\u2019s almost reliable.\u201d As noted in the site\u2019s disclaimer:   Free Wood Post is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.

    "claim": "Queen Charlotte of Britain was a mixed-race woman of African ancestry. ",
    "content": " Oprah Winfrey\u2019s interview with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry made headlines in March 2021, particularly over allegations of racism in the British royal family. It also drew renewed attention to another royal figure from British history. Markle, a biracial woman with a Black mother, seemingly made history when she married into British royalty. However, many challenged any claim she was the first \u201cBlack royal,\u201d pointing to Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, as being the first mixed-race member of the British royal family with African ancestry. This theory was also fueled by the fictional Netflix show \u201cBridgerton,\u201d which depicted a Black Queen Charlotte. We found that historians and researchers differ widely on whether Charlotte\u2014who was born in what is now Germany in 1744 and died in 1818 \u2014was mixed race, and so far have not reached a conclusive decision about her ancestry. We\u2019ll break down the theory below. The claim originated with researcher and historian Mario de Valdes y Cocom, who argued back in the \u201990s in a piece for PBS Frontline that the queen\u2019s features were \u201cconspicuously Negroid,\u201d as seen in particular portraits of her including the one shown above. Valdes wrote about her likely ancestor, as well as the queen\u2019s \u201cmulatto\u201d features: Queen Charlotte, wife of the English King George III (1738-1820), was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, a black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. [\u2026] It was the director of the Burney Project (Fanny Burney, the prolific 19th century British diarist, had been secretary to the Queen), Dr. Joyce Hemlow, who obtained from Olwen Hedly, the most recent biographer of the Queen Charlotte (1975), at least half a dozen quotes by her contemporaries regarding her negroid features. Because of its \u201cscientific\u201d source, the most valuable of Dr. Hedley\u2019s references would, probably, be the one published in the autobiography of the Queen\u2019s personal physician, Baron Stockmar, where he described her as having \u201c\u2026a true mulatto face.\u201d Margarita de Castro y Souza was a 15th-century Portuguese noblewoman whose ancestry, he claims, came from the 13th century ruler Alfonso III and his lover Madragana, whom Valdes took to be a Moor and therefore an African.       Valdes describes how Sir Allan Ramsay, the queen\u2019s portrait artist, depicted her with distinctly African features, which could have been a political gesture in that time period: \u201cArtists of that period were expected to play down, soften or even obliterate undesirable features in a subject\u2019s face. Sir Allan Ramsay was the artist responsible for the majority of the paintings of the Queen and his representations of her were the most decidedly African of all her portraits. Ramsay was an anti-slavery intellectual of his day.\u201d One such portrait can be seen here. Depictions of her varied considerably, as seen in the portraits below:     But other historians are more skeptical. Kate Williams told The Guardian that the idea that Charlotte had African ancestry raises \u201cinteresting\u201d implications for many royal families across Europe, suggesting that such a claim means arguing that her descendants could be classified as Black, including the present British royal family. But according to her and many historians, the generational distance between Charlotte and her possible African ancestor was so great that it made the suggestion \u201cridiculous.\u201d They also said there was little evidence to show that Madragana was African. Ania Loomba, a professor of literature at the University of Pennsylvania, who also teaches histories of race and colonialism, argued that if a person was described as a Moor or \u201cblackamoor,\u201d it did not necessarily mean they were Black. \u201cThe word \u2018blackamoor\u2019 in Shakespeare\u2019s time meant Muslim. It didn\u2019t mean Black necessarily,\u201d she said. \u201cMoors could be white from North Africa.\u201d Lisa Hilton, a writer of history books and historical fiction, had a similar argument: \u201cWe have no idea of what Mandragana looked like. She may have had Berber, Spanish, Arabic or indeed African features, but she might equally have had blonde hair and blue eyes, as after the fall of the Roman empire tribes from Northern Europe, including East Germany and Scandinavia, invaded the Moorish kingdoms. Moreover, the 500 years between Mandragana and Charlotte would suggest any African bloodline would have been significantly diluted.\u201d  Interestingly, back in 1999, after Valdes\u2019 research was reported on in The London Sunday Times and The Boston Globe, Buckingham Palace responded to the claim. They neither confirmed nor denied Charlotte\u2019s possible ancestry: \u201cThis has been rumored for years and years. It is a matter of history, and frankly, we\u2019ve got far more important things to talk about.\u201d Given that historians differ so widely on whether Charlotte was the first mixed-race queen in British royalty, we rate this claim as \u201cUnproven.\u201d ",

    "claim": "The Statue of Liberty was erected as a tribute to the accomplishments of black soldiers in the Civil War, and a black woman served as the model for Lady Liberty.",
    "content": "  Please read this and pass this on.  This is really some valuable information. Our children and so on need to know this kind of stuff.  Good day, It is hard to believe that after my many years of schooling (secondary and post) the following facts about the Statue of Liberty was never taught. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people including myself have visited the Statue of Liberty over the years but yet I\u2019m unable to find one person who knows the true history behind the Statue \u2013 amazing. Yes, amazing that so much important black history (such as this) is hidden from us (black and White). What makes this even worse is the fact that the current twist on history perpetuates and promotes white supremacy at the expense of black Pride. During my visit to France I saw the original Statue of Liberty. However there was a difference, the statue in France is black. \u201cYou learn something new everyday!\u201d  The Statue of Liberty was originally a black woman, but, as memory serves, it was because the model was black.   In a book called \u201cThe Journey of The Songhai People\u201d, according to Dr. Jim Haskins, a member of the National Education Advisory Committee of the Liberty-Ellis Island Committee, professor of English at the University of Florida, and prolific black author, points out that what stimulated the original idea for that 151 foot statue in the harbor.  He says that the idea for the creation of the statue initially was the part that black soldiers played in the ending of black African Bondage in the United States. It was created in the mind of the French historian Edouard de Laboulaye, chairman of the French Antislavery Society, who, together with sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, proposed to the French government that the people of France present to the people of the United States through the American Abolitionist Society, the gift of a Statue of Liberty in recognition of the fact that black soldiers won the Civil War in the United States. It was widely known then that it was black soldiers who played the pivotal role in winning the war, and this gift would be a tribute to their prowess. Suzanne Nakasian, director of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island Foundations\u2019 National Ethnic Campaign said that the black Americans\u2019 direct connection to Lady Liberty is unknown to the majority of Americans, black or WHITE. When the statue was presented to the US. Minister to France in 1884, it is said that he demonstrated that the dominant view of the broken shackles would be offensive to a US South, because since the statue was a reminder of blacks winning their freedom. It was a reminder to a beaten South of the ones who caused their defeat, their despised former captives. Documents of Proof: 1.  You may go and see the original model of the Statue of Liberty, with the broken chains at her feet and in her left hand.  Go to the Museum of the City of N.Y, Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street (212) 534-1672 or call the same number and dial ext. 208 and speak to Peter Simmons and he can send you some documentation. 2.  Check with the NY Times magazine, part II May 18, 1986. 3.  The dark original face of the Statue of Liberty can be seen in the NY Post June 17, 1986, also the Post stated the reason for the broken chains at her feet. 4.  Finally, you may check with the French Mission or the French Embassy at the U.N or in Washington, DC and ask for some original French material on the Statue of Liberty, including the Bartholdi original model. You can call in September [phone number deleted]. Please pass this information along!  Knowledge is Power!  This item about the origins of the Statue of Liberty is difficult to explicate because it makes so many (sometimes conflicting) claims, so we\u2019ll distill its essence to four primary claims and discuss those:   The model for the Statue of Liberty (i.e., the woman who posed for the sculptor, or whose portrait the sculptor used) was a black woman.  The Statue of Liberty was intended to depict a woman with features representative of the \u201cblack race.\u201d  The Statue of Liberty was created as a tribute to black Civil War soldiers.  The Statue of Liberty was intended to symbolize the end of slavery in the USA.  Of these claims, the first three are demonstrably untrue; the final one may have some small element of truth to it.       We\u2019ll begin by examining some of the specific pieces of evidence offered in the piece quoted above:  In a book called \u201cThe Journey of The Songhai People\u201d, according to Dr. Jim Haskins, a member of the National Education Advisory Committee of the Liberty-Ellis Island Committee, professor of English at the University of Florida, and prolific black author, points out that what stimulated the original idea for that 151 foot statue in the harbor.  He says that the idea for the creation of the statue initially was the part that black soldiers played in the ending of black African bondage in the United States. On his web page, Dr. Haskins explains that he wrote no book with the title The Journey of the Songhai People, nor did he ever state that the statue was presented by the people of France to the people of the United States to honor the role of black soldiers in the Civil War. It was widely known then that it was black soldiers who played the pivotal role in winning the war, and this gift would be a tribute to their prowess. It is undeniable that blacks did indeed fight in the Civil War, and that some of them were awarded high honors for their bravery in battle.  However, black soldiers were not allowed to take part in combat until the final stages of the war, and estimates place their numbers in the Union Army at about 130,000 out of 2,100,000 men total (about 12% of the total).  While this figure is hardly insignificant, claiming blacks played the \u201cpivotal role in winning the war\u201d is a bit of an exaggeration.  And however much blacks contributed to the war effort, even today, with our advantages of more than a hundred years\u2019 hindsight and access to tens of thousands of books and other sources that collectively chronicle the Civil War in almost minute-by-minute detail, the average American is little aware that blacks took active part in the conflict or is familiar with their specific contributions. (One scarcely glimpsed any black soldiers in film depictions of the Civil War until the story of the war\u2019s first all-black volunteer company was portrayed in 1989\u2019s Glory, for example.)   The level of knowledge about this subject was far less in the era immediately following the war, when communications systems were rudimentary (telephone, radio, and recorded sound did not yet exist), comprehensive accounts of the war had not been prepared (even the participants knew little of what took place outside of their direct experience), and when the still-widespread prejudice against blacks meant that their role in the war was minimized or ignored (the war may have ended slavery, but it by no means resulted in the white population\u2019s acceptance of blacks as their social equals \u2014 the U.S. Army itself remained segregated until after World War II).  The notion that over a century ago, in a country thousands of miles away, details of the Civil War unfamiliar to the people who actually fought it were \u201cwidely known\u201d is too much to accept without substantial supporting documentation. You may go and see the original model of the Statue of Liberty, with the broken chains at her feet and in her left hand.  Go to the Museum of the City of N.Y, Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street (212) 534-1672 or call the same number and dial ext. 208 and speak to Peter Simmons and he can send you some documentation. First of all, there was no one \u201coriginal model\u201d for the Statue of Liberty: sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi\u2019s design went through many evolutionary changes before he settled on its final form.  The removal of chains that appeared in Lady Liberty\u2019s hands in earlier models was done not because it \u201cwould be offensive to the U.S. South,\u201d but for aesthetic reasons.  As the same Dr. Haskins cited above wrote:  \u201cAt first, she held a broken chain in her other hand, to symbolize the broken chains of bondage; later, Bartholdi decided she should hold a tablet, inscribed with the date of the Declaration of Independence, and that a fragment of chain would be on the ground, as if she had already thrown it there.\u201d    Broken chains fit the statue\u2019s theme, whether the message of liberty gained is applied to America\u2019s independence from Britain, France\u2019s then recent struggle with Prussia, or the freeing of African Americans from slavery.  Pictures of the models for the Statue of Liberty held by The Museum of the City of New York are available for viewing via the web.  Check with the NY Times magazine, part II May 18, 1986. We did, and we found that, in anticipation of the upcoming July 4 centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty (and the culmination of a four-year, 66-million-dollar effort to repair and restore the famous monument), The New York Times magazine on that date was chock full of articles about the statue.  None of them said anything even remotely supportive of the claims made here, however; in fact, they said quite the opposite.  As Richard Bernstein, The New York Times\u2018 Paris bureau chief noted in that issue, the statue was intended as a tribute to both the American achievement of and French hopes for a nation of republic and liberty; in a sense, it was meant as an abstract symbol of the idealized future of France just as much as the realized past of America.  Creating a tribute to those who fought the Civil War (or, even more specifically, to black Civil War soldiers) was far too concrete (and too distinctly American) a concept to have been a part of their plans. The dark original face of the Statue of Liberty can be seen in the NY Post June 17, 1986, also the Post stated the reason for the broken chains at her feet. Yes, the \u201coriginal\u201d face of the Statue of Liberty was dark, for the simple reason that the materials of which it was made were originally dark.  Eric Fettmann, the author of the New York Post article cited above, wrote:  As for the photo of the supposed \u201cAfrican\u201d face featured in The Post, the picture is not \u2014 as incorrectly captioned \u2014 an early model, but shows the actual face that now stands over New York Harbor. The photo, as shown in Marvin Trachtenberg\u2019s marvelous 1976 architectural history of the statue, shows Liberty\u2019s head during construction on what was then Bedloe\u2019s Island shortly before its dedication in October 1886.  It appears \u201cblack\u201d for a simple reason: the copper statue\u2019s original color was not the familiar green we see today \u2014 the patina that naturally occurs over the course of repeated exposure to the elements \u2014 but a much darker orange-red bronze. (Actually, as the oxidation process continued, the statue first turned pitch black before reaching its current green hue, as Bartholdi knew it would.)  The reason that Fettmann offers for the broken chains is that Bartholdi \u201cadapted the statue from a failed project to construct a giant lighthouse at the entrance to the Suez Canal in Egypt\u201d; Bartholdi\u2019s original design for the lighthouse included a female figure with the broken chains of slavery at her feet. Finally, you may check with the French Mission or the French Embassy at the U.N or in Washington, DC and ask for some original French material on the Statue of Liberty, including the Bartholdi original model. The Embassy of France located in Washington would prefer not to be contacted by those looking for this \u2018original French material on the Statue of Liberty\u2019 because they can\u2019t help them. According to its Press and Information Service, \u201cWe constantly get calls from people requesting for information [on this issue], and we do not have reliable information to give them.\u201d  The statue wasn\u2019t meant as a tribute to black Civil War soldiers, nor were the women who modeled for it black.  Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, then a young French artist, was commissioned in 1865 by Edouard de Laboulaye and a group of influential French citizens to work on a monument to liberty, intended as a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States of America. Most sources agree that Bartholdi used his mistress (later his wife) and mother as Lady Liberty\u2019s models, with his mother serving as the inspiration for the face and his wife for the torso. Neither of these women was black.  As for the purpose of the statue, an 1879 design patent granted to Bartholdi contained his description of the work as \u201ca commemorative monument of the independence of the United States.\u201d There was no mention of black soldiers or the Civil War. Rather, the description specified \u201cthe independence of the United States,\u201d an event which predated the Civil War \u2014 and the abolition of slavery \u2014 by a few generations. Dr. Haskins holds that the impetus behind the Statue\u2019s creation was the abolition of slavery in America. Possibly France did not feel America deserved a monument dedicated to freedom as long as a significant portion of its population was enslaved.  That is not to say the Statue was dedicated to the abolition of slavery (else Liberty\u2019s tablet would surely have been emblazoned with the date of emancipation, not the date of its formal break from Britain), but that this happy change of affairs inspired some of those behind the gift to support the project.       One of the \u201cDocuments of Proof\u201d listed in the article, the magazine section of The New York Times from 18 May 1986, states:  The creators of the Statue of Liberty knew precisely what the message was. This group of high-minded French intellectuals, neither red revolutionaries nor white-ribboned monarchists, saw an inspirational model for France in the free institutions of the United States; they planned and designed the statue for several reasons, but chiefly to convey a subtle but unmistakable signal of republicanism to their countrymen.  \u201cThe creators of the statue wanted to praise the United States for its liberty, while at the same time suggesting to the French people that conditions were not the same in France, where the system of government was a kind of Caesarism,\u201d says Pierre Provoyeur, curator of the Museums of France and general commissioner of the French exhibitions for the statue\u2019s centennial celebration.  As a gift to the people of the United States, the statue was a kind of subterfuge, a means of promoting from outside France a political alternative for France itself. The plan worked, but the statue so evolved into an American landmark and a universal symbol that it requires an act of historical imagination for today\u2019s Frenchmen to recognize in her an image of their own past and their own political struggles.  If the statue had been intended as a tribute to prowess of black soldiers, the choice of a female form was a rather curious one.  All the combatants in the Civil War (and every other war of the era) were male, and women were not exactly the gender associated with the values of freedom and liberty in either the United States or France at that time. As Marina Warner notes in her book Monuments &amp; Maidens: The Allegory of the Female Form:  When we look at Liberty in female shape, we are not being invited to consider the freedom of women in classical times, or in the years when the statue was made and presented to the United States by the French Republic. In neither country did women enjoy equal rights, let alone special access to social and political liberties. Indeed, France was one of the last European nations to give women the vote.  In fact, the only thing said about the model on which the statue was based in The New York Times that day comes up in an excerpt from Warner\u2019s book:  Although Bartholdi\u2019s colossus has a stern, even implacable face, she remains unmistakably female, and indeed has been said to resemble Bartholdi\u2019s own mother, by all accounts a grim, overbearing woman who never overcame the outrage she felt when the family home in Colmar, Alsace, was occupied by the victorious Prussians in the war of 1870.  Another excerpt from Warner indicates that the whole \u201cthe model for the Statue of Liberty was a black woman\u201d may stem from its being confused with an earlier, abandoned project Bartholdi adapted to his new assignment:  Bartholdi\u2019s statue gives only one explicit reference to the history of the United States: the date \u2013 July 4, 1776 \u2013 in Roman numerals on the tablet she holds in her left hand. Perhaps this was because the Statue of Liberty did not originate with the plan for New York, but with a proposal Bartholdi made in the 1860\u2019s to the Khedive of Egypt, that he should build a huge lighthouse at the mouth of the Suez Canal. The maquettes of this project, \u201cEgypt Bringing Light to Asia,\u201d were directly inspired by the ancient Pharos of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. They still exist, and they reveal that had the Khedive agreed, the Statue of Liberty \u2013 in an Egyptian wig \u2013 would now be standing at the gates of the Middle East, not the New World.  Whatever the color of the person who served as the model for the Statue of Liberty may have been, the statue itself is colorless.  It does not represent a particular color of person any more than the Michelin Tire Man does, and the idea it symbolizes applies to people of all colors, whether or not its creators intended it that way.  Just as the attitudes of people who lived hundreds of years ago cannot require us look upon others as inferiors today, neither can they magically elevate the status of those who may still be the objects of discrimination.  That is a task for those of us who live here and now. ",

    "claim": "A photograph shows a pair of \"negro skin shoes.\"",
    "content": " In March 2019, we encountered an image posted on Facebook that purportedly showed a pair of \u201cnegro skin shoes\u201d:  This image captures a pair of shoes reportedly made with human skin, but the alleged \u201cdonor\u201d in this case was not an African American man \u2014 rather, it was said to be George Parrott, a wild west outlaw known as \u201cBig Nose George\u201d:  Big Nose George was a cattle rustler, highwayman, and general bandit who robbed and killed his way across the American West in the 1870s and ultimately met his demise after a failed jailbreak in 1881. An article published by the Eaton Democrat on 31 March 1881 described his lynching:  At Rawlins, Wyoming, the notorious Big Nose George was taken from jail by a party of masked men and hanged. The rope was adjusted to a cross piece on a telegraph pole and Big Nose George was made to climb the ladder set against the pole for the purpose of placing the rope about his neck. He climbed high on the ladder saying, \u201cI will jump off, boys, and break my neck,\u201d and he did.        After Big Nose George\u2019s death, Dr. John Eugene Osborne performed a crude autopsy on the bandit in an apparent attempt to study the workings of a criminal brain. We\u2019re not sure if Osborne ever managed to find out what made Big Nose George tick, but the doctor did come away with a few bizarre mementos. According to Wyoming\u2019s Carbon County Museum, Big Nose George was tanned, and his skin was used for the uppers of a pair of shoes:  On March 22, 1881, while jailed in Rawlins, George made an attempt to escape. That night, vigilantes decided to ensure he wouldn\u2019t repeat the attempt successfully. They took him from the jail and strung him up from a telegraph pole. It took two attempts, but eventually the lynching succeeded and George strangled to death. No legal action was taken against the mob. Dr. John Osborne was summoned to confirm Parrot\u2019s death. Dr. Osborne made a plaster death mask, then took the skin from Parrot\u2019s chest and thighs. He had it tanned and made into a pair of shoes and other personal items. The bandit\u2019s remains were also used to craft other personal items: for example, the top of his skull was turned into an ashtray. We reached out to the Carbon County Museum, where the shoes in this viral photograph and some of these other macabre artifacts are still on display, for more information and will update this article if more information becomes available. We did turn up one report that described Big Nose George as being of dark complexion, but couldn\u2019t find any indications that he was of African descent:  Thus ended the earthly career of Geo. Parrott, who was undoubtedly one among the most desperate and dangerous criminals that ever trod the soil of Montana. He was about 5 feet 8 inches in height, complexion very dark, narrow, sloping forehead, jet black hair, and small beadlike eyes. His most prominent feature was his large Roman nose, from which peculiarity he gained the nickname of \u201cBig Nose George.\u201d  While the shoes seen in this particular picture may not have been made from the skin of a black person, such items did exist. For instance, a brief story published on 30 March 1882 in the Atchison (Kansas) Daily Globe mentioned a physician who wore a \u201cpair of shoes made from the hide of a negro.\u201d An article from the 29 October 1887 edition of the Oskaloosa Independent relayed a similar story: I remember that two or three years ago I incidentally referred to a prominent physician of this city wearing shoes made from the skin of negroes. He still adhered to that custom, insisting that the tanned hide of an African makes the most enduring and the most pliable leather known to man. Only last week I met him upon the street with a brand new pair of shoes. I looked at his foot wear, as I always do \u2014 his pedal coverings have an irresistible fascination for me \u2013 and said, with a smile: \u201cIs the down trodden African still beneath your feet?\u201d In the most matter of fact way, and without the shadow of a smile, he answered: \u201d I suppose you mean to inquire if I still wear shoes made of the skin of a negro. I certainly do, and I don\u2019t propose changing in that respect until I find a leather that is softer and will last longer and present a better appearance. I have no sentiment about this matter. Were I a Southerner \u2013 in the American sense of the word \u2013 I might be accused of being actuated by a race prejudice. But I am a foreigner by birth, although now an American citizen by naturalization. I fought in the rebellion that the blacks might be freed. I would use a white man\u2019s skin for the same purpose if it were sufficiently thick, and if any one has a desire to wear my epidermis upon his feet after I have drawn my last breath he has my ante mortem permission.\u201d The doctor\u2019s shoes always exhibit a peculiarly rich lustrousness in their blackness. He assures me that they never hurt his feet. The new pair he was using when I last saw him emitted no creaking sound and appeared as comfortable as though they had been worn a month. Their predecessors, he told me, had been in constant use for eight months. He obtains the skins from the bodies of negroes which have been dissected in one of our big medical colleges. The best leather is obtained from the thighs. The soles are formed by placing several layers of leather together. The skin is prepared by a tanner at Womseldorf, 16 miles from Reading. The shoes are fashioned by a French shoemaker of this city, who knows nothing of the true character of the leather, but who often wonders at its exquisite smoothness, and says that it excels the finest French calf-skin. Other articles from this time period also mention items made from human leather. Scientific American reported in 1907 that human skin had been used for a variety of products, including purses, slippers, belts, and even a horse saddle. The article stated that the materials used to make these human leather items were obtained from medical schools but did not mention the race of the deceased \u201cdonors.\u201d  ",

    "claim": "A video shows a vampire squid turning itself inside out, revealing sharp barbs on the underside of its hood.",
    "content": " An animated image purporting to show a vampire squid turning itself inside out, exposing a series of sharp barbs on the underside of its hood, was posted to Reddit in May 2018: The Vampire Squid, named for its blood red color, can nearly turn itself inside out to avoid predators, revealing sharp barbs on the inside of its \u201chood.\u201d  The pictured deep sea creature is a vampyroteuthis infernalis, which literally translates to \u201cvampire squid from hell.\u201d Although this name may imply that the vampire squid is some sort of nightmarish bloodthirsty beast, the claim attached to this video is false. The \u201csharp barbs\u201d on the underside of its hood are actually soft and relatively harmless. The vampire squid is also a scavenger, not a predator: In a recent article in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, Hoving and Robison show that vampire squids eat mostly \u201cmarine snow\u201d \u2014 a mixture of dead bodies, poop, and snot. The dead bodies are the remains of microscopic algae and animals that live in the waters farther up in the ocean, but sink down into the depths after they die. The poop consists of fecal pellets from small, shrimp-like animals such as copepods or krill. The snot is mostly debris from gelatinous animals called larvaceans, which filter and consume marine snow using mucus nets.       This video does show a real vampire squid (as opposed to being a CGI mock-up) but the colors in this viral footage were digitally enhanced. It was taken by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and was featured in a 2014 video published on the YouTube page \u201cScience Friday.\u201d A slightly cropped version of this GIF can be glimpsed at the 2:30 mark of the following video:  A spokesperson for MBARI told us that the footage was taken by the organization\u2019s remotely operated vehicle Ventana on 25 April 2008, at a depth of 566 meters in Monterey Bay, California.  The vampire squid also expels bioluminescent material to confuse predators: Some large fishes and diving predators are known to eat vampire squids. Unlike shallow-water squids and octopuses, vampire squids do not expel black ink to escape predation. In the darkness of the mesopelagic zone, black or dark purple ink would not be effective. Instead the vampire squid expels a colorless substance that contains numerous particles of bioluminescent (light-producing) material. These twinkling lights confuse potential predators. It is easy to see why this creature was given the name \u201cvampire squid from hell\u201d when it was first pulled from the ocean\u2019s depths. In the ensuing years, however, researchers have discovered that this title is not very appropriate \u2014 as a matter of fact, this \u201csquid\u201d isn\u2019t even a squid at all. The vampire squid is the sole member of the Vampyromorpha order of cephalopods, and is believed to be an ancient link between the octopus and squid: Vampire squid also occupy a strange evolutionary position. They are so unusual they command their own order, a very high level of taxonomic organization. They have eight arms and fins on their head like an octopus, but they also have two long squid-like feeding filaments they use to catch and retrieve marine snow. As a result, scientists think vampire squid are extremely ancient, and may represent some of the only living descendants of the common ancestors of both octopus and squid that lived more than 200 million years ago.

    "content": "  -->   Claim:   Temporary black henna tattoos can cause permanent scarring.  PARTLY TRUE        Example:   [Collected via e-mail, June 2007]  Black Henna tattoos  Friends- I am sending this email to the majority of my address book \u2013 please pass this one on. It is so important! We were in Seaside, Florida, 2 weeks ago and decided to allow our children to get \u201chenna tattoos\u201d \u2013 the adults decided to indulge, as well. This was done at a very nice, \u201chigh-end\u201d place \u2013 next to $2 \u2013 3 million dollar homes. I asked if it was \u201csafe\u201d for children and was assured that it was a \u201cnatural\u201d dye with no consequence.  10 days later , my 7 yr. old and my 5 yr. old are having \u201csevere\u201d allergic reactions to the \u201cblack henna\u201d. Their tattoos will now, most likely, be permanent scars. They are reacting to PPD \u2013 a substance added to natural henna to make it more \u201cblack\u201d and allow it to set more quickly.  Now that my girls have been exposed to PPD \u2013 they can NEVER have their hair dyed \u2013 as it could be fatal. They can not ever use PABA \u2013 based sunscreens, they can not have \u201cSulfa\u201d anti-biotics, they can not use most cosmetics, and they can not have most drugs ending in \u201c-caine\u201d. Our first visit is to the dermatologist tomorrow and then to the allergist to determine the life long consequences of this exposure. PLEASE do not allow your children to get these \u201call natural henna tattoos\u201d unless you are 100% sure they are pure henna (which has a much lower rate of allergic reaction). MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT CONTAIN PPD! It can be a life altering decision. Take care,      Origins:   While we can\u2019t yet confirm this particular story about the two tots permanently scarred by temporary henna tattoos applied in Seaside, Florida, the risks decried in the account are at least somewhat real. For thousands of years, people have relied on henna, an Old World tropical shrub of the loosestrife family, to color their hair and decorate their skin. Pure henna is green but  dries to a dark brown or orange hue. To create body art (also known as mehndi), henna is mixed into a paste with essential oils and applied to the skin in intricate patterns. When left on the skin for at least four hours, the paste produces patterns that last up to just over three weeks.        Temporary tattoos worked in pure henna are generally safe. (It is extremely rare to develop an allergic reaction to pure henna.) However, those executed in \u201cblack henna\u201d are not always so. Black henna is a PPD-boosted synthetic version of the real thing. Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is used in these concoctions to darken designs and thereby produce dramatic black patterns. Black henna can make delicate skin erupt into blistering redness that sometimes leads to permanent scarring. The reaction can also spread, causing grotesque full-body swelling, itching, and skin sloughing. Black henna is not always safe to use. Permanent scarring can result from its application, and a tattoo meant to be worn for a few days can become a lifelong mark. Also, someone who has had a bad reaction to black henna may afterwards become extra-sensitive to PPD and similar chemicals, including some antibiotics and local anesthetics. Future reactions will likely be more severe. Even when there isn\u2019t an immediate bad reaction to a tattoo worked in black henna, just having had that form of skin art can set up the wearer for misery in the future. Thanks to the concentration of PPD in the formulation used to execute skin designs (up to 15.7%), the temporary tattoo sensitizes its wearer to that chemical. More than two-thirds of hair dyes currently contain PPD or related chemicals, which means the former tattoo wearer may well experience a delayed hypersensitivity reaction when she decides years later to change her hair color. Said reaction can range anywhere from redness and irritation around the hairline and scalp to complete swelling of the face and a rash all over the body. In 2006, the American Contact Dermatitis Society named PPD its \u201cAllergen of the Year.\u201d  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has this to say about temporary or henna tattoos:   Since henna typically produces a brown, orange-brown, or reddish-brown tint, other ingredients must be added to produce other colors, such as those marketed as \u201cblack henna\u201d and \u201cblue henna.\u201d So-called \u201cblack henna\u201d may contain the \u201ccoal tar\u201d color p-phenylenediamine, also known as PPD. This ingredient may cause allergic reactions in some individuals. The only legal use of PPD in cosmetics is as a hair dye. It is not approved for direct application to the skin. Even brown shades of products marketed as henna may contain other ingredients intended to make them darker or make the stain last longer. In addition to color additives, these skin-decorating products may contain other ingredients, such as solvents.   In 2002, North Wildwood, on an island off the New Jersey shore, joined neighboring oceanfront resort Wildwood in banning henna tattoos because it found it impossible to determine which contained FDA-approved dyes and which didn\u2019t.

    "claim": "A photograph of Franklin, the one black character on 'Peanuts,' sitting alone on Thanksgiving documents that the creator of 'Peanuts' was racist.",
    "content": " An image showing various Peanuts characters gathered around a Thanksgiving table tends to circulate online during the end-of-year holiday season, along with the accusation that it documents comic strip creator Charles M. Schulz was himself a racist for seating Franklin, the show\u2019s most visible black character, by himself on the opposite side of the table from all the other characters:  This image is a screenshot taken from the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving television special, which first aired on the CBS network on 20 November 1973: While the question of whether this particular aspect of that special should be considered \u201cracist\u201d is a subjective issue, we can shed some light on how Franklin became a Peanuts character, an action for which Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz had to fight against opposition from the comic industry. Franklin Armstrong made his first appearance in the Peanuts comic strip of 31 July 1968. At the time, the United States was struggling with desegregation, and while the country had taken several steps to integrate the population, issues about having black and white people attend the same schools, use the same bathrooms, or appear in the same comic strips were still matters of substantial controversy:        Schulz decided to add Franklin to the Peanuts gang after he began corresponding with Harriet Glickman, a retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, who was concerned about race relations in America and wrote him in 1968, shortly after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. We spoke to Glickman, now 89 years old, by phone from her Los Angeles-area home, and she told us: My parents\u2026 were very concerned about others, and the values that they instilled in us about caring for and appreciating everyone of all colors and backgrounds \u2014 this is what we knew when we were growing up, that you cared about other people. And so, during the years, we were very aware of the issues of racism and civil rights in this country. And remember, when I was young, black people had to sit at the back of the bus, black people couldn\u2019t sit in the same seats in the restaurants that you could sit\u2026 the period before I wrote the letter was the major period of civil rights activities.  Every day I would see, or read, about black children trying to get into school and seeing crowds of white people standing around spitting at them or yelling at them \u2026 and the beatings and the dogs and the hosings and the courage of so many people in that time. So it wasn\u2019t as if, one day, I said, oh things are bad and Martin Luther King was shot and I should do something. It was the accumulation of all the years of seeing the discrimination, the segregation, the hatred and all\u2026. And I just thought, Maybe I\u2019ll do something. And I realized that Peanuts was the most beloved comic strip in the country. And I wrote not only to Schulz, but I wrote to a few other cartoonists, as well. Schulz was not the only one who responded to her entreaties, Glickman said. Allen Saunders, who along with Dale Connor created the long-running Mary Worth comic strip, responded with a \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d letter that he and his team were considering including a black character in their strip but ultimately demurred over fears that they would be dropped by their syndicator. Glickman\u2019s original letter to Schulz read as follows: Schulz replied that he had previously held off on introducing a black character, not because he was worried about meeting resistance to the concept, but because he wanted to avoid seeming to be patronizing. Glickman told us that she \u201cwrote back [to Sculz] and asked him if it was okay with him to show his letter to some African American friends.\u201d It was.  Schulz soon received a letter from one of Glickman\u2019s friends, Kenneth C. Kelly, dated 6 June 1968: Dear Mr. Schulz: With regards to your correspondence with Mrs. Glickman on the subject of including Negro kids in the fabric of Peanuts, I\u2019d like to express an opinion as a Negro father of two young boys. You mention a fear of being patronizing. Though I doubt that any Negro would view your efforts that way, I\u2019d like to suggest that an accusation of being patronizing would be a small price to pay for the positive results that would accrue! We have a situation in America in which racial enmity is constantly portrayed. The inclusion of a Negro supernumerary in some of the group scenes in Peanuts would do two important things. Firstly, it would ease my problem of having my kids seeing themselves pictured in the overall American scene. Secondly, it would suggest racial amity in a casual day-to-day sense. I deliberately suggest a supernumerary role for a Negro character. The inclusion of a Negro in your occasional group scenes would quietly and unobtrusively set the stage for a principal character at a later date, should the basis for such a principal develop. We have too long used Negro supernumeraries in such unhappy situations as a movie prison scene, while excluding Negro supernumeraries in quiet and normal scenes of people just living, loving, worrying, entering a hotel, the lobby of an office building, a downtown New York City street scene. There are insidious negative effects in these practices of the movie industry, TV industry, magazine publishing, and syndicated cartoons. Sincerely, KCK       Franklin made his debut less than two months later, but as a full-fledged (albeit sporadically appearing) friend of Charlie Brown\u2019s rather than as the suggested background character.  This was no small thing for a nationally syndicated comic strip, especially at the peak of the United States\u2019 race-related civil unrest of 1968 and 1969. However, Schulz\u2019s decision to add a black character to Peanuts did meet with resistance from some quarters. The comic book artist said in a 1988 interview that his editors continually wanted to change the comics in which Franklin appeared: I finally put Franklin in, and there was one strip where Charlie Brown and Franklin had been playing on the beach, and Franklin said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s been nice being with you, come on over to my house some time.\u201d Again, they didn\u2019t like that. Another editor protested once when Franklin was sitting in the same row of school desks with Peppermint Patty, and said, \u201cWe have enough trouble here in the South without you showing the kids together in school.\u201d But I never paid any attention to those things, and I remember telling Larry at the time about Franklin \u2014 he wanted me to change it, and we talked about it for a long while on the phone, and I finally sighed and said, \u201cWell, Larry, let\u2019s put it this way: Either you print it just the way I draw it or I quit. How\u2019s that?\u201d So that\u2019s the way that ended. While some have applauded Schulz for including a black character in his comic strip, others have criticized him for how the character was handled. Nat Gertler, the author of \u201cThe Peanuts Collection: Treasures from the World\u2019s Most Beloved Comic Strip,\u201d wrote that while Charles M. Schulz\u2019 inclusion of a black character was controversial, he was also overly cautious with how the character was used: Franklin\u2019s introduction was part of a five-day sequence featuring Sally tossing away Charlie Brown\u2019s beach ball and Franklin rescuing it. In some ways, this seems an aggressive bit of integration \u2014 many American public beaches, while no longer legally segregated, were still de facto segregated at the time. In other ways, the strips suggest what might be seen today as an excess of caution; of the twenty panels of the series, Franklin is in ten panels and Sally is in eight, but never is Franklin in the same panel as the white girl. Franklin would not reappear for another two and a half months, when he came for a visit to Charlie Brown\u2019s neighborhood. He was somewhat lighter skinned here, which seems to be less a matter of trying to make him acceptable to the readers and more a matter of cutting back on shading lines which were overpowering his facial features. Franklin\u2019s job in this series was to react to the oddness of the neighborhood kids, and that was a precursor to what would be his primary role in the strip as a whole. Perhaps due to excessive caution, Franklin was never granted any of the sort of usual quirks that define a Peanuts character, the very sort of mistake that Glickman was warning about when she called for one of the black kids to be \u201ca Lucy.\u201d Schulz may have had more to work with if he had listened to Bishop James P. Shannon, who had marched beside Martin Luther King in Selma; Shannon was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as wondering if the new Peanuts character would be \u201ca believable human being who has some evident personal failing,\u201d versus being \u201ca perfect little black man.\u201d But whatever failings (or problematic lack of failings) Franklin may have had, his appearance drew national media coverage, and made local comics page editors flinch. Charles M. Schulz did not discuss Franklin\u2019s seating position in A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, but he did respond to another accusation of racism regarding a strip published in November 1974:  Fifteen years ago, when the strip was drawn, I believe there was only one black in the national hockey league. Does pointing out this fact make the strip racist? Nat Gertler, author of the aforementioned book about Peanuts, another called The Snoopy Treasures: An Illustrated Celebration of the World Famous Beagle, and the AAUGH Blog, reached out to us after seeing this article, and wrote: The article does leave hanging out there the assumption that Charles Schulz himself planned the admittedly awkward shot being referenced. While Schulz definitely kept a hand in the animated work, by 1973 when the Thanksgiving special aired, the Peanuts characters were starring in not only a steady stream of TV specials, but also a series of animated feature films. Schulz certainly wasn\u2019t laying out every shot himself \u2014 he had a day job to take care of, writing and drawing the most popular comic strip going, as well as creating original books, handling licensing materials, and so on. A talented team of animation folks were doing their job on this. Besides, if you look, Franklin may not have had a table mate, but he did get more desserts than anyone! Franklin was not the first minority character in the strip (he\u2019s predated by semi-Latino Jose Peterson), nor the only African-American character (although he is by far the most visible.) But yes, Schulz stuck his neck out introducing Franklin at all, and I\u2019m glad this article is there to counter this rather frivolous accusation. \u2013Nat Gertler (PS: Peanuts nitpickers will tell you that the name \u201cFranklin Armstrong\u201d is non-canonical; the last name was introduced in an animated special, and in the eyes of Schulz as well as the hard-core fans, that doesn\u2019t count!) According to Cesar Gallegos, the archivist for the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, California, the response to Franklin\u2019s introduction was, despite some editorial resistance, overwhelmingly positive from the reading audience. ",

Although the image prompted a good deal of political comment on the web, it was not a genuine photograph; rather, it was a digital manipulation posted by the web site All the Right Snark on 1 December 2014. The image received a viral push on 7 January 2015 when it was republished by several conservative blogs, including the Conservative Tribune:           If there is a more divisive slogan to have come out of the aftermath of the untimely deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner than \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d I don\u2019t know what it is. It would be so simple to use \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d and at least have the opportunity to unite the entire country behind their cause instead of furthering a racial divide that they claim to denounce. But there are good reasons why the race rioters can\u2019t put \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d on their signs \u2014 they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. Many, many more black lives are taken every year by other blacks than by police officers of any color. The fact that these deaths go without protest is a clear indicator that the demonstrations are not pro-black, but anti-cop. #BlackLivesMatter\u2026 But only when they\u2019re killed by cops.

Not so much.\u201d The original photograph, which was taken during a vigil held by the Black Law Student Association at Southern Illinois University on 22 October 2014, did not include this message:   To commemorate the event and to identify with others involved in the movement, the students then unrolled a banner from the second floor balcony which read \u201c#Black Lives Matter.\u201d \u201cSome may ask the question, why are we here and why is this cause so important and urgent?\u201d said first-year law student Willie Lyles III. \u201cA friend of mine, Dr. Katrina Gamble, summed it up this way \u2014 \u2018We are fighting for our humanity\u2026 When I think one day my young nephew\u2019s life might be in danger for simply existing in his black skin, the urgency of this fight is undeniable. What is at stake can\u2019t be captured with words. It can only be felt and seen in the eyes of those weary from the heartache and rage that comes with seeing so many black lives taken.'\u201d           Last updated:   9 January 2015   Sources:    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"BLACK LAW STUDENT ASSOCIATION HOSTS 'BLACK LIVES MATTER' DAY OF ACTION VIGIL.\"  &nbsp; &nbsp; Southern Illinois University. &nbsp; 22 October 2014.   --> ",
