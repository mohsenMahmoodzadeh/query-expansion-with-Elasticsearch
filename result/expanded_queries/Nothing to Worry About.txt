    "claim": "NASA issued a warning that Earth could be hit by an asteroid around Christmas 2019. ",
    "content": " On Oct. 23, 2019, the U.K. tabloid Express published an article that left some readers believing they need not make Christmas plans this year because Earth was in danger of being hit by a large asteroid:  The article was entitled \u201cAsteroid terror: NASA spot mammoth space rock to hit Earth\u2019s orbit five days before X-mas.\u201d The subheading gave earthlings an even smaller chance of survival: \u201cAN ASTEROID the size of the World Trade Centre is on a dangerous Earth-bound orbit that could see the rock smash the planet during Christmas festivities.\u201d When the article was regurgitated by even less-reputable websites, the fear-mongering title morphed into a factually inaccurate claim. For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title \u201cNASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!\u201d NASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas.        These articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there\u2019s nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1. NASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles. Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is \u201cnothing unusual or dangerous\u201d about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1: No, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth. Astronomers have been observing this asteroid\u2019s position for 13 years, we know its orbit very accurately, we can predict its close approaches accurately for the next 200 years, and we know with certainty that it cannot hit our planet. Lindley Johnson, NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Officer and Program Executive of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), also told us that this asteroid \u201cposes no hazard to impacting earth\u201d:  NASA and other US agencies are lead players in the international effort to develop plans to respond to a possible Near-Earth Object (NEO) impact. In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States\u2014and the world\u2014for detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic. NASA is approximately 35% complete for NEOs 140 meters and larger, and approximately 96% complete for those 1 km and larger. Strategic investments in our space-based programs will lead to the benefit of all of humanity as we continue to catalogue any NEOs that pose a potential threat. This particular asteroid\u2019s trajectory has been well tracked by NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies since it\u2019s discovery 13 years and poses no hazard to impacting Earth. Here\u2019s a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS. The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours):  On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026 \u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.       NASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does.  But the 19,000 NEOs in NASA\u2019s database aren\u2019t really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered: Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 \u2013 approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size \u2013 takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact \u2013 such as the Chelyabinsk event \u2013 could occur at any time. Still, the chances of an asteroid larger than 140 meters hitting earth in the next 100 years is minimal: The current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size\u2013larger than a small football stadium\u2013and to characterize a subset representative of the entire population. Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date. Asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 will pass by Earth a few days before Christmas. However, NASA has issued no warnings about a catastrophic impact, and CNEOS reports that this asteroid will get no closer than 3 million miles from Earth during its approach.  ",

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.   In early April 2020, the Trump administration was facing strong criticism for its response to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Against that backdrop, social media users shared posts critical of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leaders of the administration\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 response. The posts accused Fauci of throwing U.S. President Donald Trump under the bus for a belated response to the growing public health crisis, while failing himself to adequately warn the American public of the looming disease threat. Social media posts by Trump\u2019s supporters highlighted an April 12, 2020, interview on CNN in which host Jake Tapper asked Fauci, \u201cDo you think lives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started third week of February, instead of mid-March?\u201d To that question, Fauci gave the answer that earned him the ire of Trump\u2019s supporters: You know, Jake, again, it\u2019s the what would have, what could have. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is \u2014 is complicated. But you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.       In rebuttal to this perceived criticism of the Trump administration, social media users accused Fauci of himself minimizing the threat in a Feb. 29 television interview. One such tweet, bearing the hashtag #FireFauci was retweeted by Trump on April 12, 2020, raising speculation that the president was preparing to fire the doctor.  Another tweet complained that Fauci had said it was \u201csafe\u201d to do things like go to the movies and the gym in early February and March but \u201cdropped Trump in the grease on CNN,\u201d or let the president take the blame. These criticisms ignore the context of Fauci\u2019s Feb. 29 commentary and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 situation. On Feb. 29, Fauci gave an interview on the NBC morning talk show \u201cToday,\u201d during which he stated that at that moment in time, \u201cthe risk is still low, but this could change.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said that many times even on this program,\u201d Fauci stated in that interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201d The situation with COVID-19 in the United States was indeed drastically different on Feb. 29 than it was in mid-April.       On Feb. 29, news reports indicated there were 70 known cases in the U.S., and officials were reporting the first known death from the novel coronavirus on American soil. That day also saw the first few reports of \u201ccommunity spread,\u201d or transmission of the disease from an unknown source. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that Americans did not need to change their routines for the time being, but he also noted that depending on how the COVID-19 outbreak played out, that could all change, and in the coming weeks, it did. Since that day, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, more than half a million cases have been reported in the United States, and the death toll has rapidly climbed past 20,000 with most of the American public under guidance to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus. Fauci later clarified that in the April 12 interview, he was responding to a \u201chypothetical\u201d question about the administration\u2019s response but noted that his wording choice was \u201cpoor\u201d and that administration officials had in fact heeded his early recommendations about social distancing guidelines. Fauci also noted that his comments in a CNN interview were interpreted by some to mean that the Trump administration gave medical experts \u201cpush back\u201d that cost lives at the beginning of the outbreak. He acknowledged that his answer was not worded well and largely misconstrued. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d ",

    "claim": "Young women are inserting vodka-soaked tampons as a furtive way of getting drunk.",
    "content": " Although whispers about young women trying to furtively get their alcohol buzzes on by inserting vodka-soaked tampons into themselves have existed for more than fifteen years (our oldest printed reference dates to 1999, but the rumor is likely a fair bit older than that), cases documenting instances of women actually engaging in such a practice are rare to non-existent and well short of proving it to be the widespread phenomenon rumor makes it out to be.  Nonetheless, as with so many other stories about supposedly worrisome teen crazes, news outlets periodically run stories proclaiming insertion of \u201cvodka tampons\u201d to be a real and common activity, stories based on little or nothing more than mere repetition of rumor (e.g., \u201cWe\u2019ve heard teens are doing this\u201d). Arguing strongly against such rumors is the nature of tampons themselves. While these cylindrical compacted wads of cotton and/or rayon do soak up liquid readily (which is their purpose, after all), they also become nigh on impossible to insert into any bodily orifice when they are in such a saturated state.  Also, as blog editor Danielle Crittenden discovered when she experimented with the procedure, putting vodka into direct contact with vaginal membranes hurts like the dickens, with the pain not retreating after a few moments of discomfort but rather continuing unabated for as long as the liquor is present (and indeed well after). Crittenden\u2019s research also showed even a \u201csuper-plus\u201d tampon could absorb only 1.5 ounces of vodka, with a half ounce of that having to be wrung from it prior to insertion. The amount of alcohol therefore available to provide a buzz to thrill-seeking teens would be akin to that found in one typical mixed drink, a tipple hardly worth going to the trouble of inserting a vodka-soaked tampon into one\u2019s nether regions even if the procedure were pain-free and could be showed to work. As to why anyone would want to ingest alcohol in this fashion, three reasons are given for the purported practice: To do away with the problem of the smell of booze on one\u2019s breath, to bypass the stomach and thus more quickly benefit from the full effect of the hooch, and to eliminate the sort of gastric distress that leaves a heavy imbiber clutching the porcelain god at 4 a.m.       The most commonly-given reason, the avoidance of bowery breath, has the least going for it. If one were to ingest vodka vaginally (or anally, as the rumor is also expressed that way), the practice wouldn\u2019t result in booze-free breath because alcohol is partially expelled from the body via the lungs. Once liquor is in the blood, at least some of it gets breathed out, which is how breathalyzers measure blood alcohol content.  Also, the rumor\u2019s lynchpin, that as long as a teen gal has sweet breath her parents won\u2019t know their little darling has been tippling, isn\u2019t all that practical. It\u2019s not easy to conceal being three sheets to the wind; drunken behavior often gives the game away long before the stink of booze does.  Any teen who thinks avoiding parental detection is nothing but a matter of masking or eliminating the scent is probably in for a rude surprise. Even if putting liquor into direct contact with the mucus membranes of the vagina or rectum worked to speed alcohol into the bloodstream, the practice might come at a cost. Such membranes are sensitive, and the potential burning discomfort of flooding those areas with John Barleycorn\u2019s finest could prove memorable and not nearly adequately compensate for having advanced one\u2019s inebriation by a matter of minutes. Some claim taking in vodka through the insertion of liquor-soaked tampons might (and we\u2019re not going to test this theory, so we\u2019ll leave it at \u201cmight\u201d) work to keep one\u2019s dinner in place during a fierce night of partying, citing the notion it avoids the presence of large amounts of alcohol into the stomach, a presence that works to irritate the lining of that organ and thus prompt regurgitation of its contents.  (However, vomiting is one of the body\u2019s defense mechanisms against poisoning, so suppressing or avoiding that function is not generally a good idea.  In 2005, for example, a woman was charged with negligent homicide for administering a sherry enema that caused the death of her husband from alcohol poisoning.)  Another putative reason given for imbibing in this manner is bypassing the stomach avoids the calories associated with alcohol consumption. The rumor has become particularly attached to the Scottish rock band Mogwai. According to lore, while trapped in a European tour environment where hooch was hard to come by, the band members soaked tampons in vodka and inserted them into their rectal cavities in order to facilitate the swift and efficient entry of the small available stock of alcohol into their bloodstreams. The group maintains they never did this, and the belief they did arose from an innocent conversation with a journalist in which mere discussion of the practice was subsequently misremembered by that reporter as the group\u2019s having claimed to have participated in the activity themselves. Sightings:   Vodka-soaked tampons were referenced in an episode of the television crime drama CSI (\u201cTwo and a Half Deaths,\u201d original air date 8 May 2008). Also, in the TV series The Girlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce (\u201cRule No. 67: Don\u2019t Kill the Princess,\u201d original air date 13 January 2015), Lilly\u2019s14th birthday party is enlivened by the sudden cascade of her friends into the pool after vodka-soaked tampons have caused severe sensations of burning and stinging in the nether regions of the young partygoers.

    "content": " Claim:   An employer issued a missive to his employees stating that any additional taxes on his business would result in his shutting the company down.  LEGEND  Example:   [Collected via e-mail, November 2008]        To All My Valued Employees, There have been some rumblings around the office about the future of this company, and more specifically, your job. As you know, the economy has changed for the worse and presents many challenges. However, the good news is this: The economy doesn\u2019t pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job however, is the changing political landscape in this country. Of course, as your employer, I am forbidden to tell you whom to vote for \u2013 it is against the law to discriminate based on political affiliation, race, creed, religion, etc. Please vote who you think will serve your interests the best. However, let me tell you some little tidbits of fact which might help you decide what is in your best interest. First, while it is easy to spew rhetoric that casts employers against employees, you have to understand that for every business owner there is a back story. This back story is often neglected and overshadowed by what you see and hear. Sure, you see me park my Mercedes outside. You\u2019ve seen my big home at last year\u2019s Christmas party. I\u2019m sure all these flashy icons of luxury conjure up some idealized thoughts about my life. However, what you don\u2019t see is the back story. I started this company 12 years ago. At that time, I lived in a 300 square foot studio apartment for 3 years. My entire living space was converted into an office so I could put forth 100% effort into building a company, which by the way, would eventually employ you. My diet consisted of Ramen Pride noodles because every dollar I spent went back into this company. I drove a rusty Toyota Corolla with a defective transmission. I didn\u2019t have time to date. Often times, I stayed home on weekends, while my friends went out drinking and partying. In fact, I was married to my business \u2014 hard work, discipline, and sacrifice. Meanwhile, my friends got jobs. They worked 40 hours a week and made a modest $50K a year and spent every dime they earned. They drove flashy cars and lived in expensive homes and wore fancy designer clothes. Instead of hitting the Nordstrom\u2019s for the latest hot fashion item, I was trolling through the Goodwill store extracting any clothing item that didn\u2019t look like it was birthed in the 70\u2019s. My friends refinanced their mortgages and lived a life of luxury. I, however, did not. I put my time, my money, and my life into a business with a vision that eventually, some day, I too, will be able to afford these luxuries my friends supposedly had. So, while you physically arrive at the office at 9am, mentally check in at about noon, and then leave at 5pm, I don\u2019t. There is no \u201coff\u201d button for me. When you leave the office, you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself. I unfortunately do not have the freedom. I eat, ****, and breathe this company every minute of the day. There is no rest. There is no weekend. There is no happy hour. Every day this business is attached to my hip like a 1 year old special-needs child. You, of course, only see the fruits of that garden \u2014 the nice house, the Mercedes, the vacations\u2026 you never realize the back story and the sacrifices I\u2019ve made. Now, the economy is falling apart and I, the guy that made all the right decisions and saved his money, have to bail-out all the people who didn\u2019t. The people that overspent their paychecks suddenly feel entitled to the same luxuries that I earned and sacrificed a decade of my life for. Yes, business ownership has is benefits but the price I\u2019ve paid is steep and without wounds. Unfortunately, the cost of running this business, and employing you, is starting to eclipse the threshold of marginal benefit and let me tell you why: I am being taxed to death and the government thinks I don\u2019t pay enough.  I have state taxes. Federal taxes. Property taxes. Sales and use taxes. Payroll taxes. Workers compensation taxes. Unemployment taxes. Taxes on taxes. I have to hire a tax man to manage all these taxes and then guess what? I have to pay taxes for employing him. Government mandates and regulations and all the accounting that goes with it, now occupy most of my time. On Oct 15th, I wrote a check to the US Treasury for $288,000 for quarterly taxes. You know what my \u201cstimulus\u201d check was? Zero. Nada. Zilch. The question I have is this: Who is stimulating the economy? Me, the guy who has provided 14 people good paying jobs and serves over 2,200,000 people per year with a flourishing business? Or, the single mother sitting at home pregnant with her fourth child waiting for her next welfare check? Obviously, government feels the latter is the economic stimulus of this country. The fact is, if I deducted (Read: Stole) 50% of your paycheck you\u2019d quit and you wouldn\u2019t work here. I mean, why should you? That\u2019s nuts. Who wants to get rewarded only 50% of their hard work? Well, I agree which is why your job is in jeopardy. Here is what many of you don\u2019t understand \u2026 to stimulate the economy you need to stimulate what runs the economy. Had suddenly government mandated to me that I didn\u2019t need to pay taxes, guess what? Instead of depositing that $288,000 into the Washington black-hole, I would have spent it, hired more employees, and generated substantial economic growth. My employees would have enjoyed the wealth of that tax cut in the form of promotions and better salaries. But you can forget it now. When you have a comatose man on the verge of death, you don\u2019t defibrillate and shock his thumb thinking that will bring him back to life, do you? Or, do you defibrillate his heart? Business is at the heart of America and always has been. To restart it, you must stimulate it, not kill it. Suddenly, the power brokers in Washington believe the mud of America are the essential drivers of the American economic engine. Nothing could be further from the truth and this is the type of change you can keep. So where am I going with all this? It\u2019s quite simple. If any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, my reaction will be swift and simple. I fire you. I fire your co-workers. You can then plead with the government to pay for your mortgage, your SUV, and your child\u2019s future. Frankly, it isn\u2019t my problem anymore. Then, I will close this company down, move to another country, and retire. You see, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done with a country that penalizes the productive and gives to the unproductive. My motivation to work and to provide jobs will be destroyed, and with it, will be my citizenship. While tax cuts to 95% of America sounds great on paper, don\u2019t forget the back story: If there is no job, there is no income to tax. A tax cut on zero dollars is zero. So, when you make decision to vote, ask yourself, who understands the economics of business ownership and who doesn\u2019t? Whose policies will endanger your job? Answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of saving your job. While the media wants to tell you \u201cIt\u2019s the economy stupid\u201d I\u2019m telling you it isn\u2019t. If you lose your job, it won\u2019t be at the hands of the economy; it will be at the hands of a political hurricane that swept through this country, steamrolled the constitution, and will have changed its landscape forever. If that happens, you can find me in South Caribbean sitting on a beach, retired, and with no employees to worry about. Signed, Your boss      Origins:   In the ramp-up towards the 2008 Presidential election and in its wake, a number of anonymous \u201cHere\u2019s how you, the ones who voted for him, will directly suffer from a Barack Obama presidency\u201d missives landed in inboxes everywhere. One such was putatively from a hard-working and generous grandfather telling his beloved liberal granddaughter that her support for Obama meant Grandpa was no longer going to be in a position to help her financially. Another was supposedly penned by CEO to his 140 employees informing them that thanks to the new taxes now surely headed his way, he\u2019d have to lay off a few of them, so he was starting with those whose cars sported Obama bumper stickers.\u201d The \u201cTo All My Valued Employees\u201d letter quoted above is another of such ilk. In it, a boss threatens to shut down his company (thus wiping out the livelihoods of the 14 people who work there) if any more taxes are levied upon him, an outcome he views a virtual  certainty under an Obama presidency.  The piece is perhaps best viewed as an attempt to put into real-world terms the possible consequences to average folks if business is interfered with to the point of no longer being able to operate rather than as an actual letter sent by a real boss to his employees.  Although our earliest sighting of this item dates to 3 November 2008, textual clues within the missive (such as \u201cPlease vote who you think will serve your interests the best\u201d and \u201cSo, when you make decision to vote\u201d) indicate it was likely penned sooner than just the day before the 2008 presidential election.       The original author of this piece is unknown to us. While some versions are merely signed \u201cYour Boss,\u201d others are attributed to Michael A. Crowley of Wake Forest, North Carolina, via inclusion of his signature block at the end of the piece. Crowley himself denies authorship, saying:   In reference to the \u201cTo all my valued employees\u201d letter currently circulating the internet:  This letter was forwarded to me by a colleague. While the letter may indeed be authentic, I was not the author and I do not know the identity of the original author. I forwarded it to the \u201cJohn McCain Joe the Plumbers\u201d email group prior to the election. Someone moved my contact information into the body of the message making it appear that I was the author of the letter. I would appreciate your removing my contact information prior to forwarding this message.  Michael A. Crowley, PE   While sometimes people looking to distance themselves from soapbox pieces they\u2019ve penned subsequently claim they found such contentious items elsewhere on the Internet and merely forwarded them to others, that is not the case here. More than just Crowley\u2019s own words of denial support his claim of non-authorship, with the key to that proof lying in the very signature block that has worked to convince so many of his being the real \u201cboss\u201d behind the letter. That signature block identifies his firm as Crowley, Crisp &amp; Associates, Inc., a now defunct business entity that (according to North Carolina\u2019s Secretary of State) was formed in May 2007.  The missive so widely laid at Crowley\u2019s feet states \u201cI started this company 12 years ago.\u201d Twelve years prior to 2008 was 1996. (His current firm, Crowley &amp; Associates, Inc., was formed in October 2000.) Were Crowley the actual author, that line about when he began his company would have read \u201clast year\u201d or \u201c8 years ago.\u201d  e-mail asserts the business run by the tax-burdened boss \"serves over 2,200,000 people per year.\" We're dubious about such a claim being made of a civil engineering firm, because if only its actual clients are counted, that figure would be in the single to double digits, and if all the people served by various public works that firm has participated in are enumerated in the proffered count, that number would likely greatly exceed the stated 2.2 million. --> The response to the missive falsely attributed to him prompted Michael Crowley to pen his own letter on the plight of the small business owner, which can be read here. In October 2012, David Siegel, the founder and CEO of Westgate Resorts, sent a modified version of this letter to all of his employees. He based his missive on that much-circulated 2008 piece, saying of his offering: \u201cI did use the letter that had circulated before as a guideline, but I changed it [to fit my circumstances]. It speaks the truth and it gives [employees] something to think about when they go to the polls.\u201d  Last updated:   9 October 2012   Sources:    &nbsp; &nbsp; McCaslin, John. &nbsp; \"Inside the Beltway.\"  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Washington Times. &nbsp; 26 February 2002.    --> ",

    "claim": "The Trump administration is paying Southwest Key $458 million to run immigrant child detention centers, and its CEO earns a $1.5 million salary.",
    "content": " In late June 2018, a series of investigative news reports exposed the fact that Juan Sanchez, the chief executive of non-profit Southwest Key, was making a salary of $1.5 million while his organization had scored $458 million in federal grants to shelter detained children who had been taken from their parents at the southern U.S. border. The reports came amid widespread outrage over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy and as viral stories often do, resulted in a number of memes that spread throughout social media:  Introducing pic.twitter.com/aYaDYIY38z \u2014 Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) June 21, 2018  Although memes are not always factual, the one shared by actor Samuel Jackson is. The figures were taken from a 19 June 2018 Bloomberg report: The nonprofit, Southwest Key Programs Inc., is to be paid more than $458 million in fiscal 2018, according to the data \u2014 the most among the organizations, government agencies and companies that run a detention and care system for immigrant children on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services. Southwest Key has about a dozen facilities in Texas, including a site at a former WalMart Inc. store in Brownsville that has drawn attention from members of Congress and national news organizations. [\u2026] Southwest Key rapidly increased the compensation of its CEO, Juan Sanchez, from about $269,000 in 2010 to more than $786,000 in 2015, the most recent year for which its tax returns are available through the website Guidestar.org. His compensation nearly doubled to $1.5 million in 2016, according to tax records for an Austin charter school he founded.       We independently confirmed with tax records publicly available through the non-profit tracking site Guidestar.org and public financial data posted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees programs for unaccompanied immigrant children, that the figures reported by Bloomberg are accurate. Sanchez\u2019s salary and money awarded to his non-profit both ballooned in recent years. In fiscal year 2017, Southwest Key was awarded more than $285,000,000 and about $211,000,000 in 2016. Sanchez\u2019s salary roughly doubled from 2015 to 2016. The Austin-based charity runs 27 immigrant children\u2019s shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, according to an archived version of its web site (which is currently down). It has been awarded almost half of the $948 million budgeted for the care of unaccompanied immigrant children by HHS. Southwest Key became the focus of heightened scrutiny in June 2018 amid outcry over Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy enacted in April 2018. Under the policy, all adults who cross the border between ports of entry were charged with federal offenses and their accompanying children were taken from them. Many of those children were placed at Southwest Key facilities, including Casa Padre, a converted WalMart in Brownsville, Texas reportedly holding 1,500. As people began asking questions about the welfare and whereabouts of the children, unpleasant answers began emerging. Among those providing those answers has been Antar Davidson, a 32-year-old whistleblower who worked at Estrella del Norte, a Southwest Key shelter in Tucson, Arizona from February 21 to 12 June 2018. Davidson described scenes of chaos after \u201czero tolerance\u201d went into effect. The facility was unprepared for the stream of younger children that began around May. The children, he said, were traumatized, disoriented, and acting out, running around, throwing things and fighting. \u201cIt was really a big mess,\u201d he told us in a phone interview. Davidson, who is of Brazilian descent, said he would hold classes for the martial art form capoeira. But during classes, \u201csome little six or seven year old would run in and an employee would be chasing them down.\u201d Many times, he said, the children had to be physically restrained by staffers. Training for situations requiring restraint increased in frequency when the younger children started showing up.  Davidson, who quit his job out of disillusionment, confirmed a story first reported by the Los Angeles Times. At one point he was asked to translate for a group of Brazilian siblings, aged six, ten and 16, who had been separated from their parents. The distraught, crying children, who were clinging to each other, were separated and placed in different parts of the facility because they were of different ages and genders. He was told to prevent them from hugging, because the shelter has a strict \u201cno touching\u201d policy. The result of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy has been that more than 2,000 children have been taken from their parents at the border. The Trump administration has provided no information on how they will be reunified. Wrenching news stories and audio published by ProPublica of weeping children calling for their parents after being separated drew public outrage. In response, Trump signed an executive order on 20 June 2018 that does not reunite families already separated but seeks to change laws limiting the amount of time children can spend in detention, which could result in families being in detention indefinitely. We attempted to contact Southwest Key for comment and received no response. ",

    "content": "  Claim:   Man battles $0.00 charge that won\u2019t go away.  LEGEND        Examples:   [Collected via e-mail, 1998] In March 1992 a man living in Newtown near Boston Massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it away. In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn\u2019t send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they\u2019d take care of it. The following month our hero decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been cancelled.  He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man\u2019s bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash. The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt. The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.       [Collected via e-mail, 1998] What a world? (country NSW\u2026 (New South Wales.. Australia))\u2026 On Thursday, 24 January 2002,  Derek Guille broadcast this story on his afternoon program on ABC  radio. In March, 1999, a man living in Kandos (near Mudgee in NSW received a bill for his as yet unused gas line stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it away. In April he received another bill and threw that one away too. The following month the gas company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his gas line if he didn\u2019t send them $0.00 by return mail. He called them, talked to them, and they said it was a computer error and they would take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome gas line figuring that if there was usage on the account it would put an end to this ridiculous predicament. However, when he went to use the gas, it had been cut off. He called the gas company who apologised for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got  a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to them the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake, so  he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00. This bill also stated that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally, giving in, he thought he would beat the company at their own game and mailed them a cheque [check] for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the gas company nothing at all. A week later, the manager of the Mudgee branch of the Westpac Banking Corporation called our hapless friend and asked him what he was doing writing cheque for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank manager replied that the $0.00 cheque had caused their cheque processing software to fail. The bank could therefore not process ANY cheques they had received from ANY of their customers that day because the cheque for $0.00 had caused the computer to crash. The following month the man received a letter from the gas company claiming that his cheque has bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a cheque by return mail they would take immediate steps to recover the debt. At this point, the man decided to file a debt harassment claim against the gas company. It took him nearly 2 hours to convince the clerks at the local courthouse that he was not joking. They subsequently assisted him in the drafting of statements which were considered substantive evidence of the aggravation and difficulties he had been forced to endure during this debacle. The matter was heard in the Magistrate\u2019s Court in Mudgee and the outcome was this: The gas company was ordered to: [1] Immediately rectify their computerised accounts system or show cause, within 10 days, why the matter should not be referred to a higher court for consideration under Company Law. [2] Pay the bank dishonour fees incurred by the man. [3] Pay the bank dishonour fees incurred by all the Westpac clients whose cheques had been bounced on the day our friend\u2019s had  been. [4] Pay the claimant\u2019s court costs; and [5] Pay the claimant a total of $1500 per month for the 5 month period March to July inclusive as compensation for the aggravation they had caused their client to suffer. And all this over $0.00. This story can also be viewed on the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) website. Who employed these idiots??            Origins:   This wacky tale of billing technology gone horribly wrong first appeared on the Internet in July 1997. It\u2019s pointless to ask if this e-mailed tale is a true story because not enough details were provided in the text to give anyone much hope of tracking this specific version to a source. We\u2019re told this happened in 1992 to a man in Newtown, Massachussetts, but there is no such town. (There is a Newton, however, in that area.) Neither the man nor the credit card company are named, adding to the difficulties of finding out if the particulars of this story are  real. Later versions of the same e-mail omitted the name of the town and altered the text to \u201cA man living near Boston \u2026\u201d Even later versions re-inserted the name of the town, this time changing it to Newton. In 2003 it reappeared as a tale about a man living in Australia. It\u2019s best we forget about trying to find this mystery man and instead look at the story. There\u2019s nothing implausible about receiving a zero-sum statement; people get them all the time. What elevates this particular cyber-version into the realm of legend are the additional details tacked on after that event. This story works as an engaging piece of fiction because of the mounting sense of frustration the victim endures as the people he turns to for help prove incapable of undoing what a machine has done. He finally (he thinks) figures a way to beat the machine at its own game by sending a $0.00 check to pay the $0.00 bill, but in doing so causes his bank\u2019s computer to hit the bricks and his check to bounce, prompting yet another dunning notice from the credit card company. It\u2019s great tale, but it\u2019s probably not a real one: It\u2019s unlikely that a zero-dollar check could or did cause a financial institution\u2019s computers to crash. If that were all it took, people looking for a few extra days before checks they\u2019d written cleared their accounts (or pranksters merely seeking to wreak industrial havoc) would have routinely deposited zero-dollar checks in order to bring banking systems to their knees.   Variations on this story have been around for years. This one comes from a 1970 joke book:         Winning a battle with a computer system is getting to be more fun than sneaking into the subway through an exit gate used to be when we were kids. Let\u2019s give a great big hand to latest winner Jerome T. Parker. Mr. Parker, for reasons unknown to him, received a bill from an oil company for several consecutive months for $0.00. He laughingly showed the bills to friends and waited for the bills to stop coming. When he got one marked \u201cFinal Notice,\u201d however, plus a threat to turn the account over to a notoriously tough collection agency, he wrote out a check for no dollars and no cents, signed his name thereto, and mailed it to the oil company with a note saying, \u201cThis pays my account in full.\u201d Damned if he didn\u2019t get a form letter in return thanking him for his patronage.   The reason for this tale\u2019s growing popularity of late may well have been captured in the first line of that 1970 example: \u201cWinning a battle with a computer system.\u201d As computers come to play ever-increasing roles in our lives, so grows our resentment of them. We fear the thought of someday falling at their mercy, and the $0.00 story expresses this anxiety. In this Kafka-esque tale, the hero is unable to get any of the humans he speaks with to unravel the mess and ultimately has to resort to playing the computer\u2019s game to beat it. Chilling thought, that, and we fear that is indeed the way our world is going. In August 1999, Ann Landers ran the following letter from a reader:   DEAR ANN LANDERS: When I read your column about outrageous billing statements, I decided to send you my story. When I was in college, I took out guaranteed student loans. After graduation, while still repaying the loans, I was informed that they had defaulted and had been turned over to the state collection agency. I had no idea why.  It took seven years of letter writing, hiring a lawyer and appealing to my congressperson to straighten out the mess. It turned out that my file at the bank had fallen behind a filing cabinet. Can you believe it? It actually happened. I am not making this up. The U.S. Department of Education dropped all penalty charges, and I paid off the balance in full. End of story, right? Wrong. Keep reading.  After the loan was cleared up, I began to receive billing letters from the Department of Education. What was so funny, was that the bills reported no balance due \u2014 no principal, penalties or interest. But the letters began none too cordially with, \u201cWarning-Warning-Warning! Your scheduled payment is seriously overdue!\u201d The letters contained several threats about the consequences if I didn\u2019t pay off my zero balance immediately. Go figure. I received no fewer than 11 of these threatening letters, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are more in the pipeline.   In October 1999 another of Ann\u2019s reader\u2019s came forward to tell her $0.00 tale:   Dear Ann: I just read the letter from C.M. in Milpitas, Calif., who said the Department of Education lost her file and kept billing her for her student loan. After the mess was finally straightened out, she received bills demanding she pay a balance of $0. That\u2019s right \u2014 zero dollars.  This happened to me as well. A financial-aid adviser told me that the quickest way to solve the problem was to \u201dpay\u201d the bill, so I wrote a cheque for $0. This is the only to stop the computer from sending statement letters. Calling customer services is useless because they don\u2019t always communicate with the billing departments. Since I sent that cheque, I have not been bothered. But get this \u2014 the billing department actually tried to cash it.   Can $0.00 billings occur? Ask a bookkeeper who has dealt with a computerized receivables system that generates finance charges but does not round off the amounts. In a situation where an overdue account has attracted a finance charge, such bills can occur when the customer pays his bill. As far as the computer is concerned, a debt of  still exists, so the program sends this information to the printer at statement printing time. However, because the program has also been coded not to print fractional cent amounts, it spits out a $0.00 statement.  (The same reasoning applies to one person\u2019s online explanation of why Yahoo! sent him a payment check for $0.00.) In the now-vanished world where competent bookkeepers oversaw the receivables process, such oddities were caught before they were mailed out, and a reversing entry to cancel the fractional finance charge was entered to soothe the electronic beast. In the modern world, statements are all too often automatically stuffed into window envelopes (by yet more machines!), franked, and mailed, and accounting personnel think a reversing entry is something one performs to back into a parking space.       One would hope that when matters reach the \u201ctelephone for help\u201d stage they get straightened out, but then I still believe in the myth of the competent bookkeeper.

    "claim": "A photograph of children in orange jumpsuits depicts detained immigrant children.",
    "content": " In early June 2018, we received numerous e-mails from readers about a Facebook post showing immigrant children in orange jumpsuits: When and where was the picture of child prisoners in orange jumpsuits taken? Is it really of immigrant children separated from their families?  Sending you a photo, going around Facebook with immigrant children, supposedly removed from parents at US borders, posing at a detention facility, wearing orange prison jumpsuits. MOST posts are challenging as \u201cFake News\u201d, a lawyer friend says this is probably staged since PHOTOGRAPHS are not permitted in Homeland Security facilities nor the private prison contractors FOUR that we know of in TX. Church groups, lawyers, family can go, but cellphones &amp; cameras are forbidden, so we\u2019re wondering how did THIS PHOTO get so posed with the kids? Perhaps you\u2019ve already seen this photo? NO source on any of the photos. YES, it\u2019s tragic that children are being separated from parents &amp; being held in detention, like prison facilities, but I don\u2019t think we need to stage a photo. My church group friends, I know for a fact, distributed 670 backpacks Christmas week 2017, to CHILDREN LOCKED UP at Karnes County Detention Center, (Texas) Yes. 670 children, alone.  There is a photo going around on Facebook of children dressed in orange prison jumpsuits. There is no attribution to the photo. It is being used as proof of children who have been taken from their parents crossing the border. I would Ike to know where this photo is from and when it was taken. I have a feeling it is not what it claims to be. Several included a link to a Facebook post shared by Occupy Democrats on 8 June 2018: This shouldn\u2019t be happening in America, PERIOD. Follow Occupy Democrats for more! I don\u2019t care how you try to spin it. Children are not criminals. They don\u2019t belong in cages, PERIOD!        Neither the caption nor the image text used any immigration-specific wording, but no source for the photographs was provided. A reverse image search shows that the image appeared online as early as 2014 (and possibly earlier):  The photograph was originally used to illustrate a claim that in the United States, prisons are constructed more frequently than schools:  In 2014, the photograph accompanied an article about schools and prisons. It appears to be a still from the following video from Californians for Safety and Justice:  A description provides further insight: Russell Simmons served as Executive Producer for Californians for Safety and Justice\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d video as part of its #SchoolsNotPrisons campaign, which calls for replacing prison and justice system waste with common sense solutions that create safe neighborhoods and save public dollars. The image likely caught on because of a real photograph that was leaked from a Texas courtroom which shows the mass trials that result from the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy, along with a story that appeared in The Intercept: A very small, very young woman with chiseled features and disheveled hair spoke. She had been apprehended two days earlier after rafting across the Rio Grande near a county park with big trees and picnic tables that abuts the international line. She wept as she told Morgan, \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, but the circumstances in my country made me do it.\u201d She said she\u2019d been almost raped and killed there, and she had come to the U.S. for protection and to see if she could help her sisters escape the danger. \u201cYou are going to be sent to one of the immigration camps,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou can try and request asylum.\u201d By May 10, Morgan was starting to get rattled by the increasingly disturbing content of the allocutions. By then, the government had begun systematically separating mothers and fathers from their children, including children who are preschoolers. A week later, the government announced plans to house the children on military bases. ",

The text of the \u201crebuttal\u201d meme began by stating:  I am a school teacher in Denmark making about $61,000/year. We get free education. You don\u2019t have to pay for the doctor or the hospital, and students even get paid to learn. It all sounds so great \u2026 right? However, I forgot to mention that nothing is ever free \u2026 The minimum income tax in Denmark is 40%.  A reliable estimate of the average salary for teachers in Denmark is somewhat tricky to calculate due to variables such as tenure and location. However, a 2014 estimate provided an income figure of just under $42,000 per year for Danish teachers (not $61,000). And it\u2019s slightly simplistic to say all healthcare is free in Denmark, as the cost of medical care varies depending upon residency status and coverage level. The rebuttal also states that the minimum income tax is 40% in Denmark (where tax revenue indeed comprised 48.6% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2013). Taxpayers in Denmark are subject to a progressive tax structure under which total taxes are between 41 to 56 percent of income [PDF]:  Most personal income is subject to AM tax of 8%. This tax is deducted from the income before the other taxes are calculated. The income tax rates are progressive and comprise state, municipality and church taxes. The lowest tax rate is approx. 36% up to a marginal income tax rate of 51.95% exclusive of church tax. Including AM tax, the rates are 41% and 56%.  Another portion of the meme indicated that Denmark\u2019s citizens were \u201cdeeply dependent\u201d on welfare to survive, but the country\u2019s unemployment rate of 6.3% was not much higher than the United States\u2019 5.3% in the same period. The meme continued:  Also, [we] pay a sales tax of 25%, and on top of that the Government applies duties and fees. A gallon of gasoline is about $10. Tax on a car is 180%, meaning that a car that sells for about $25,000 in the United States (Honda Accord) to an astounding $45,000 in Denmark.        Value-added tax (VAT) in Denmark is indeed 25%&lt;, though additional \u201cduties and fees\u201d weren\u2019t specifically described by the meme. Gasoline is typically sold by the liter (not gallon) in Europe overall, and recent estimates provided a cost of $1.69 per liter in Denmark (or just under $6.40 a gallon, not $10). It\u2019s true that new cars in Denmark are taxed at 180%, in large part because Denmark (like some other countries) imposes higher costs of operation for private automobiles to encourage residents to use public transport and more energy-efficient and lower-polluting forms of transportation.  Denmark is the highest-taxed Nation in the World \u2014 taxed an average 80% on every dollar earned. Danes have the highest personal debt in the World. Few will ever own a car or a house. Anyone who makes over $80,000 annually pays a personal tax of 68%. This means that people with higher earnings have either found ways to evade the tax or have left the Country, taking their companies with them.  Definitively selecting a single country to claim the title of \u201chighest-taxed\u201d is a slippery endeavor, as the structure of taxation varies significantly from one country to the next. Reports on taxes across the globe (including a popular annual data set released by firm PwC) almost never declare any one country the most-taxed (in a vacuum). Myriad confounding factors (such as relative cost of living, and whether social programs cover basic needs like healthcare) render a binary comparison of that description virtually meaningless. However, a list titled \u201cThese are the 19 countries with the highest tax rates in the world\u201d (based on the World Economic Forum\u2019s latest Global Competitiveness Report), published on October 8, 2015 did not include Denmark among the countries listed. By the metric of income tax rates, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data for 2015 placed Denmark third-highest (behind Belgium and Germany). Similar, earlier data ranked Denmark behind France, Italy, and Croatia. As such, Denmark doesn\u2019t even have the highest tax rate in Europe (much less the world). We were unable to corroborate the claim that \u201c80% on every dollar earned\u201d in Denmark goes toward taxes; and determining which nations could be accurately described as having the highest amount of personal debt in the world again hinges largely on variable factors such as GDP, average income, and number of citizens. (Without specifics, those numbers could easily be distorted by fluctuations in population, for instance.) OECD data for 2014 indicated Denmark had the highest percentage of household debt based on percentage of disposable income:             That same table placed Denmark mid-to-high for comparative household net worth:       In 2013 Denmark\u2019s home ownership rate was roughly 63% (versus a comparable 65% in the U.S.), making the statement that \u201cmost residents would never own a home\u201d not very accurate. Similarly, recent OECD data indicated that there are 70 cars for every 100 Danes (indicating car ownership may be expensive, but it isn\u2019t rare). A 2007 New York Times article reported that some young Danes opt to move abroad (creating a skills drain), but that piece focused on individuals and not companies with business roots in the country. The meme concludes:  Denmark\u2019s suicide rate for the past five decades has averaged 20.8 per 100,000 people, with a highest rate of 32. The American suicide rate has averaged 11.1 during the last five decades and has never exceeded 12.7. More than 11% of adult Danes \u2014 supposedly the happiest people in the World \u2014 are on antidepressants. Everyone wants the American dream. In Denmark\u2019s neo-communism economy, no one will ever own or accomplish anything.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s most recent statistics, Denmark\u2019s suicide rate was 8.8 people per 100,000 (versus 12.1 per 100,000 in the United States) in 2012. WHO data from roughly a decade ago reported a suicide rate of 11.9 per 100,000 people in Denmark (versus 11.0 in the United States). While the U.S. and Denmark maintained similar rates of suicide per capita in years past, Denmark\u2019s suicide rate was markedly lower than that of the States by 2012 (and didn\u2019t appear to ever have been three times as high). Determining which percentage of the Danish population takes antidepressants is currently complicated by the fact that such data aren\u2019t readily available as standard metrics on health care reports. A 2013 Guardian article cited&lt; a survey conducted by Eurobarometer indicating that 93 percent of Danes reported never having taken antidepressants in their lives. Presumably, the remaining seven percent weren\u2019t all currently taking antidepressants, indicating the meme\u2019s claim was likely unsupported. OECD data from 2012 indicated that 85 doses of antidepressant medications were dispensed per thousand people per day (DDD) in Denmark. Directly comparable data from the United States with respect to DDD wasn\u2019t available (as that metric appears unique to Europe). Estimates suggest that between eight and eleven percent of Americans are on antidepressants [PDF], and the 2013 study \u201cDepression and Antidepressants: A Nordic Perspective\u201d suggested fewer Danes than Americans took antidepressants at any given time (while maintaining that Nordic countries exhibited a higher rate of antidepressant use than Europe overall):   The overall sales of antidepressant drugs in the Nordic countries in 2009 (74.1 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day) is [considerably] higher than the OECD average (52.5), but also higher than for example in the UK (60.9) (20). However, there are great variations between the countries, where Iceland by far has the highest level of antidepressant sales, almost double that in Norway. In total, approximately 2 million Nordic inhabitants were prescribed an antidepressant, almost a share of 8.5% at a total cost of \u20ac236 million according to latest available statistics (ranging from 2010 to 2012). Danish medical statistics shows that there were sales of antidepressants in 2011 of \u20ac68 million and over 460 000 Danes were prescribed an antidepressant (8.3% of the population) (21). With respect to the claims made in the initial meme, it\u2019s (again) not entirely true that Danish schoolteachers earn $61,000 per year across the board. It\u2019s true that Danes are paid a stipend to go to university, and that college education is free for Danish students (and EU residents studying in that country). As indicated above, healthcare is often administered at no charge to Danes, depending on the service and their coverage status. And to reiterate, portions above addressed the prevalence of home ownership in Denmark, which is roughly equivalent to that of the U.S; personal ownership of vehicles is less common, but by no means rare. As for vacation time, workers in Denmark are entitled to five paid weeks of it (as well as additional compensated time off totaling about nine days, from which the \u201csix weeks\u201d figure was most likely derived). Denmark\u2019s parental leave policies are among the most generous in the world, but 52 weeks (or one year) is on the upper end of leave with partial or total pay:  The Danish parental leave system is among the most generous and flexible in the EU. Mothers are entitled to 4 weeks of maternity leave before the expected date of birth and 14 weeks of maternity leave after the birth. Fathers are entitled to 2 weeks of paternity leave within the first 14 weeks after the birth. Furthermore, each parent is entitled to 32 weeks of parental leave. Parents can receive maternity leave benefits from the State for a maximum of 52 weeks per child if they meet the employment criteria set out in the Maternity Leave Act.  It\u2019s true that pension kicks in for Danes at age 65. The original meme claimed that the average American spent $8,500 per year in deductibles, while the Centers for Disease control placed average total spending per patient per year at $9,255 in 2013. We were unable to find a figure that specifically referenced \u201cdeductibles\u201d as a health care expenditure-related metric, but the number cited closely matched World Bank figures for per capita health expenditures. Cited college costs for students in the United States in the first meme weren\u2019t exaggerated either: data from 2014 place the yearly cost of tuition at a low of $18,943 (for in-state public schools) and a high of $42,419 (for out-of-state private schools). If it\u2019s surmised that three out of four students attend a local college at the cheaper tuition and one heads off to a private university, the average tuition between those four students would be $24,812. Finally, Denmark\u2019s novel \u201cflexicurity\u201d policy deviates from other European nations\u2019 worker protection policies (which are unlike American \u201cat will employment\u201d standards). While Danes can be more easily fired than those in other European countries, the country offers robust unemployment insurance compensation to level out labor market fluctuations. In short, it\u2019s true Denmark\u2019s taxes are far higher than those in the United States; but that\u2019s offset by significantly reduced costs to citizens for expenditures such as healthcare, education, and child care. A gallon of gas doesn\u2019t cost Danes anywhere near $10, but tax on new cars is 180%. We were unable to find any ranking of Denmark as the \u201chighest-taxed\u201d nation in the world (or even just Europe), and home ownership rates are near what they are in the U.S. (There are far more privately-owned vehicles in the United States than Denmark, however.) Denmark\u2019s suicide rate is lower than that of the U.S., and antidepressant usage is higher among Americans. Finally, while some young Danes moved abroad due to high taxes on income, we were unable to find any evidence that was the case for companies. ",

    "claim": " Plastic bottle caps can be redeemed to provide chemotherapy treatments to cancer sufferers or prosthetic limbs for wounded soldiers.",
    "content": " It is difficult to turn one\u2019s back on an appeal for help, especially one made on behalf of a gravely ill child. People want to help; their hearts do go out to others, no matter what their own circumstances might be.  That one simple inescapable fact worked to fuel a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d hoax in and around West Virginia through the summer and fall of 2008:  [The Roanoke Times, August 2008] There is a request going around in our area asking for plastic bottle caps of any kind \u2014 water bottles, soda, laundry detergent, etc.  Supposedly, if you save 1,500 of these caps, someone is entitled to a free chemo treatment.  [Collected via e-mail, September 2008] I have heard about collecting bottle caps for cancer patients. Apparently, for every 1,000 caps collected, a patient can receive a chemotherapy treatment.  [Collected via e-mail, October 2008] I have been asked to collect used bottle caps from plastic bottles (pepsi and coke). I was told that these caps are given to chemo patients who are uninsured for chemo treatment. They are supposed to receive one minute of free chemo for one bottle cap.  Somehow people came to believe that a child in need of chemotherapy could be benefited through the collection of plastic caps from milk jugs, soda bottles, and water bottles; that for every so many of those items collected, that ailing tot would be given a chemo session free of charge. No one knew the identity of the child (although some who repeated the rumor specified he was a 5-year-old boy), and the details about how many caps would earn a free session (some said 1,000, some said 1,500, some said one minute for each plastic top) shifted from telling to telling. As to who would be providing those cost-free cancer treatments, that too was up in the air: Over time, various hospitals were named as the putative parties that would trade chemo for caps, as was the American Cancer Society. The method by which such a swap was to occur (e.g., boxloads of caps handed over in exchange for chemo sessions;  recycling of the caps for cash, then using of the money so garnered to pay for the treatments) also varied depending on the person passing along the rumor.  The collection effort was all in the name of aiding a sick kid. Never mind that no one knew the child\u2019s name or where he lived, or what to do with the caps, or who was behind the supposed \u201ccaps for chemo\u201d program \u2014 somewhere an unnamed youngster was languishing for lack of the medical help the plastic tops of bottles could bring. Your plastic bottles. It was heady stuff.       Heady enough to keep people from looking too hard at the hoax in front of them and risking their seeing it for what it was. Plastic bottle caps have no inherent monetary value. Unlike aluminum cans (and the metal tabs attached to them), they aren\u2019t worth anything as raw material because such caps are the wrong form of plastic to be recycled. There is therefore virtually no market for used plastic bottle tops.  But even though the collected bottle caps weren\u2019t worth anything in and of themselves, and no large corporation was trumpeting its involvement in the rumored \u201cSave a kid by saving your bottle caps\u201d program, people\u2019s desire to help blinded them to those realities. Little worked to stop the spread of the hoax once it was underway. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint precisely when and where the \u201csave a cancer-stricken child by saving your bottle caps\u201d belief first surfaced, the manager of one concern in Beckley, West Virginia, says her store began collecting lids in June 2008 after her minister announced he had heard by phone of a lad who would receive one chemotherapy treatment for 1,500 lids. Parishioners were entreated to save their caps to aid this child, and to pass on this request to their co-workers and other contacts. Said lids were to be taken to Raleigh General Hospital, a medical facility in that city.  (According to the hospital\u2019s marketing director, Kevin McGraw, that facility is not and never has been involved in such a program. One of its employees, however, was collecting the caps by the vanload in the belief these otherwise discardables would help cancer patients, which is perhaps where the link between the caps collection and Raleigh General began.) Other churches in the area were similarly involved in the harvesting of bottle caps for the unnamed child. They too asked their churchgoers to save these bottle caps and to ask their friends, neighbors, and employers to do so.  From there the rumor spread: In August 2008, Associated Press reported that \u201cchurches, restaurants and businesses from Wheeling to Bluefield have been collecting plastic bottle caps, fueled by fliers that claim the caps can be redeemed for money to pay for cancer treatment.\u201d Many people were taken in by the hoax. Girl Scouts Troop 650 of Ellerslie, Maryland, collected plastic bottle caps and turned them in to Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia, believing their efforts would give a cancer patient one free chemotherapy treatment.  Collection bins at area stores and businesses in Beckley, West Virginia, were stocked with thousands of bottle caps by folks who thought they were helping some poor unfortunate child gain the chemo treatments he or she so desperately needed.  Yet there never was such a child or such a program on his or her behalf. All efforts to locate the ailing tot failed, as did those to work out who to turn the caps over to or how to turn them into chemo treatments for anyone. The American Cancer Society has this to say about the hoax:  After extensive research, the American Cancer Society has concluded that the Plastic Bottle Caps for Chemo program is a hoax. The origin of the hoax remains unclear, but it is similar to other \u201ccash for trash\u201d hoaxes that have circulated worldwide for years.        Thousands upon thousands of lovingly-collected caps were unceremoniously dumped in the trash once the hoax was revealed. Collection bins were taken down, and new donations of caps were turned away.  It is true that occasionally a large company will \u201credeem\u201d up to a certain number of lids or labels from its products for a cash amount to be directed to a particular charity or cause (e.g., Yoplait\u2018s annual commitment to donate 10\u00a2 per lid from its products to breast cancer research via its \u201cFriends In The Fight\u201d program, up to a maximum donation of $1.6 million). However, such beneficences are specific product promotions meant to encourage purchase of the items bearing those labels or lids and to position the host company favorably in the shopper\u2019s mind as a warm, caring corporation committed to aiding mankind. Such promotions don\u2019t encompass every lid or label from all manner of consumer goods (including those of competitors), and the name of the business entity sponsoring the largesse is prominently featured in everything having to do with the promotion.  In August 2010 another version of the bottle cap hoax appeared at Bagram Airfield, a U.S. Air Force base in Afghanistan. Motivated by a rumor that came from no one knew where, personnel at that base began collecting caps from empty water bottles in the belief that those items would be recycled into prosthetic limbs for disabled servicemembers. Bins to collect these caps sprang up around the base, and thousands (likely hundreds of thousands) of caps were tossed into them.  Missing in all of this charitable activity was any notion of who was responsible for assembling the large collection of caps and transporting it, or where the shipment was to be sent for processing into artificial limbs. The local Judge Advocate General (JAG) office investigated the rumor and attempted to pin down the main point of contact (POC) for the cap drive, but while drop-off locations for the plastic tops were easily found, the trails dead-ended at them.  Lt. Col. Thomas Rodrigues, the JAG officer running the investigation, said: \u201cNot surprisingly, with every interview at each collection site, no one had an overall POC, knew who the actual beneficiary was, or what to do with the collected caps.\u201d Contact with Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics, Inc., the largest prosthetic limb manufacturer, confirmed that the rumor had indeed been a snipe hunt. The prosthetic company\u2019s public relations representative said that military members in need of artificial limbs receive new, top-of-the-line prosthetics, and recycled bottle caps would never be used in such products.

    "claim": "A video shows Koko the gorilla spontaneously using sign language to issue a warning about climate change.",
    "content": " If you want an audience to take heed of what you have to say, sometimes the messenger who delivers it for you can be just as important as the message itself. Depending on the nature of your communiqu\u00e9, you may find it has a much greater impact on your intended audience if it is conveyed a a sympathetic figure who can tug at people\u2019s heartstrings (e.g., a child, a Native American, a mother, a veteran) or a respected figure whom viewers perceive as knowledgeable about the subject at hand (e.g., a judge, a policeman, a college professor). A messenger who brought both those qualities to the table was Koko the gorilla, a primate who purportedly understands approximately 2,000 words of the spoken human language and can communicate her thoughts to humans via her use of more than 1,000 signs of what \u2018Gorilla Sign Language\u2019 (a modified version of American Sign Language). In 2015 two non-profit organizations, the Gorilla Foundation (who oversee Koko\u2019s care and training), and NOE Conservation (who seek to safeguard biodiversity), teamed up to produce a Public Service Announcement (PSA) featuring Koko in conjunction with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as the COP21 Climate Conference) held in Paris in December of that year:  That video captured Koko supposedly signing about the importance of our protecting and preserving nature, a message that (given the nature of the proceedings it was associated with) was interpreted as a plea to acknowledge the issue of climate change. The NOE said as much, declaring that the video captured \u201cKoko reacting after she has been informed about what is at stake at COP21.\u201d And the press release issued with the video by the Gorilla Foundation asserted that Koko was indeed being \u201cclear\u201d about wanting to convey the notion that \u201cMan is harming the Earth\u201d: Because of her unique ability to communicate with humans in sign language, Koko is a natural ambassador for endangered species, and thus we agreed to co-produce a short video PSA (Public Service Announcement) contingent on Koko\u2019s willingness to participate. Koko was clear about the main message: Man is harming the Earth and its many animal and plant species and needs to \u201churry\u201d and fix the problem.       We humans may disagree on the possibly deleterious effects our activities are having on our global environment, but how could we possibly ignore a poignant plea from a gorilla \u2014 a message delivered by a personification of Nature itself, who is not coincidentally regarded as sympathetic and knowledgeable regarding the subject at hand? Some viewers took the video a little too literally, however, and were surprised at Koko\u2019s pithy and timely exhortation to heed the perils of global warming. But nothing about the video indicates that Koko can actually entertain, much less communicate to humans, thoughts about environmentalism. For starters, as noted in a 2014 Slate, human-ape communication may be far more about anthropomorphization than actual linguistic expression, especially when it comes to the expressing ideas rather than communicating basic needs: [C]onceding that the scientific jury is still out on whether gorillas are capable of sophisticated emotions doesn\u2019t make headlines, and admitting the ambiguity inherent in interpreting a gorilla\u2019s sign language doesn\u2019t bring in millions of dollars in donations. So we get a story about Koko mourning Robin Williams: a nice, straightforward tale that warms the heart but leaves scientists and skeptics wondering how a gorilla\u2019s emotions can be deduced so easily. Koko is perhaps the most famous product of an ambitious field of research, one that sought from the outset to examine whether apes and humans could communicate. In dozens of studies, scientists raised apes with humans and attempted to teach them language. Dedicated researchers brought apes like Koko into their homes or turned their labs into home-like environments where people and apes could play together and try, often awkwardly, to understand each other. The researchers made these apes the center of their lives. But the research didn\u2019t deliver on its promise. No new studies have been launched in years, and the old ones are fizzling out. A behind-the-scenes look at what remains of this research today reveals a surprisingly dramatic world of lawsuits, mass resignations, and dysfunctional relationships between humans and apes. Unlike us, it seems that apes don\u2019t care to chitchat. Psychologist Susan Goldin-Meadow points out that studies with Kanzi (a bonobo) show that only 4 percent of his signs are commentary, meaning the other 96 percent are all functional signs, asking for food or toys. Similar skepticism about Koko emerged in the 1980s, when Herb Terrace published a fairly scathing critique of ape language research. Among other criticisms, Terrace asserted that Koko\u2019s signs were not spontaneous but instead elicited by [her handler\u2019s] asking her questions. In any case, Koko\u2019s supposed message about climate change and biodiversity is completely lacking in context: the viewer has no idea what any offscreen handlers might have said or done to elicit the signing she produces, or whether the video is anything more than a collection of disjoint, completely unrelated signs strung together into a narrative fashioned by humans rather than a gorilla. Even if we were to assume the (highly unlikely) possibility that Koko\u2019s signing was completely spontaneous and unguided, her \u201cmessage\u201d is highly ambiguous and non-specific \u2014 outside of humans\u2019 suggesting a framework for us to employ in interpreting it: I am gorilla. I am flowers, animals. I am nature. Man Koko love. Earth Koko love. But Man stupid. Stupid! Koko sorry. Koko cry. Time hurry! Fix Earth! Help Earth! Hurry! Protect Earth. Nature see you. Thank you. For all we know, this discourse might have been prompted by Koko\u2019s having just witnessed a clumsy gardener on a power mower carelessly amputating a crop of blooming roses in a nearby flowerbed, and she\u2019s expressing that she wants someone to repair the damage by reattaching the severed buds to their stems. Even the Gorilla Foundation admitted that Koko was \u201cbriefed\u201d on the subject at hand and provided with a \u201cscript\u201d for the video, which was \u201cedited from a number of separate takes\u201d: Turns out Koko was very interested in the subject [of preserving biodiversity], which we briefed her on via a recent issue of National Geographic titled \u201cCool It!\u201d We also presented her with a script drafted by NOE (as any celebrity ambassador asked to do a PSA would expect) and allowed her to improvise during s series of brief daily video discussion sessions, in which Koko also had to learn a few new signs, such as \u201cProtect\u201d and \u201cNature.\u201d The resulting PSA was edited from a number of separate takes, for brevity and continuity.       Barbara King, a biological anthropologist at the College of William and Mary who writes about human evolution, primate behavior, and the cognition and emotion of animals, commented on the the Koko PSA thusly for NPR: [R]eminds me of earlier attempts by the Gorilla Foundation to showcase Koko\u2019s ability to understand things that there\u2019s little chance she could understand, at least in the ways suggested. Anthropomorphism \u2014 the projection of so-called human qualities onto other animals \u2014 is not inevitably wrong. Other animals may share with us many ways of thinking and feeling, and recognizing that fact is often appropriate. But the anthropomorphism in this video is not appropriate. Not even linguistically inclined apes comprehend anything close to the dynamic interplay between humans and nature that underlies anthropogenic climate change. King also quoted Sherman Wilcox, professor of linguistics at the University of New Mexico, as saying in reaction to this video: This is obviously a doctored video composed of highly edited clips of single signs pieced together to make it look like Koko is actually saying something, when she\u2019s not. It is disconcerting on so many levels. I fear it diminishes the seriousness of the climate change issue. Climate change deniers already feel like scientists are lying to the public. We don\u2019t need to give them fake videos. A Huffington Post article on the topic similarly quoted skeptics from the fields of linguistics and primate research: But can a gorilla really grasp abstract concepts like climate change and biodiversity? \u201cOf course not,\u201d Herbert Terrace, director of Columbia University\u2019s Primate Cognition Lab, told The Huffington Post. Terrace criticized the video as \u201chighly misleading\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t know what Koko\u2019s trainer was signing to her before she uttered the various signs \u2026 attributed to her.\u201d Frans de Waal, director of Emory University\u2019s Living Links primate research center, suggested that the conservation video hurts the credibility of those who study animal intelligence. \u201cKoko\u2019s human-coached message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla understands or cares about, such as human global impact,\u201d de Waal told HuffPost. He added that \u201cstunts\u201d like this one \u201chave given the ape-language field a bad name, whereas there is so much more to discover if we just study what cognitively advanced animals can do of their own accord.\u201d \u201cThe problem comes in when we take an ape\u2019s accomplishments and then \u2026 insist \u2026 on putting her forward as a wise old woman, and she\u2019s not,\u201d [Barbara] King said. The Koko climate change PSA is a novel and compelling way of focusing viewer attention on a political message, but it\u2019s basically just a staged commercial, not an expression of sagacity about Nature issued by a non-human creature.
