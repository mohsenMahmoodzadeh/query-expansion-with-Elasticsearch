The ball drop in New York City\u2019s Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve is going to look a little bit different in 2020. In fact, this will be the first time since that crowds will be prohibited from gathering there to celebrate the end of the year:        Times Square\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve festivities began on Dec. 31, 1904, in a celebration that marked both the new year and the renaming of Longacre Square as Times Square after The New York Times moved into the Times Building (now One Times Square). Here\u2019s the front page of The New York Times from Jan. 1, 1905:  Sun, Jan 1, 1905 \u2013 Page 1 \u00b7 The New York Times (New York, New York) \u00b7 Newspapers.com While Times Square has seen crowds, fireworks, and other New Year\u2019s Eve festivities since 1904, it wasn\u2019t until 1907 that the celebration featured the iconic \u201cball drop.\u201d In a 2015 article looking back at the history of New Year\u2019s celebrations in Times Square, The New York Times wrote: The marriage of The Times and New Year\u2019s Eve began Dec. 31, 1904, when the newspaper moved its headquarters from Lower Manhattan into a 24-story tower bounded by Broadway, Seventh Avenue and West 42nd Street. The intersection, and the area around it, had been known a year earlier as Longacre Square. The Times saw to it that the name was changed. [\u2026] When the first firework shot 1,000 feet into the air, the crowd below knew the new year had arrived. \u201cNo more beautiful picture was ever limned in fire on the curtain of midnight,\u201d The Times said in its lead news article on Page 1, using the cool, dispassionate, objective style of writing for which it was renowned. \u201cFrom base to dome, the giant structure was alight \u2014 a torch to usher in the new born, a funeral pyre for the old which pierced the very heavens.\u201d [\u2026] After two more years of pyrotechnics, The Times found a less flammable way to signal the moment of midnight: an iron-and-wood ball, five feet in diameter, on which 100 25-watt bulbs were mounted. It was to be lowered down a flagstaff at midnight on Dec. 31, 1907. A spokesperson for the Times Square Alliance confirmed to Snopes that this will truly be the first time that crowds will be prohibited from gathering to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. The streets won\u2019t be completely empty, however. The New York Times reports that there will be a few hundred people (compared to hundreds of thousands in previous years) gathered for the celebration, including dozens of front-line workers: This New Year\u2019s Eve, just a few hundred will gather in the square \u2014 dozens of frontline workers among them \u2014 and only then by special invitation. With temperatures checked and face masks secured, they will represent a nation holding a mirror to the lips of 2020 to confirm that there is no fogging, that the year has mercifully ceased to be.       It should also be noted that this is not the first time festivities in Times Square have been impacted by current events. During World War I, Times Square was open to the public, but the festivities were rather subdued. On Jan 1, 1918, The New York Times wrote that the new year \u201cslunk in with rubber shoes on\u201d:  Tue, Jan 1, 1918 \u2013 Page 17 \u00b7 The New York Times (New York, New York) \u00b7 Newspapers.com The following year, the war was over, and according to a Jan. 1, 1919, article from the Brooklyn Eagle, the city was to have its \u201cFirst Real New Year\u2019s Eve in 3 years.\u201d This new year\u2019s took place in the middle of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. While many people still gathered in Times Square in celebration of the new year and the end of the war, this may have helped spread the disease. The CDC notes that a \u201cthird wave\u201d of the pandemic arose around this time, and in January 1919 \u201cseven-hundred and six cases of influenza and 67 deaths [were] reported in New York City, triggering fear of a recurrence of severe flu activity.\u201d The New Year\u2019s festivities were also subdued during the second world war. In 1942 and 1943, for instance, no ball was dropped in Times Square, nor were there any fireworks or bright neon displays, due to dim-outs related to World War II. While these dim-outs (cities turned off their lights as protection against air attacks) made the festivities a little less bright, crowds still gathered in Times Square during these years. The New York Daily News wrote on Dec. 31, 1942: It will be furious and festive \u2013 this New Year\u2019s Eve. The night clubs will be jammed \u2013 more than ever, this year, they say. So will the theaters and the restaurants\u2026. and yet, it\u2019s going to be different. The cast of war lies over New York. The fabled lights, the long miles of neon tubing and the winking spectaculars of Broadway are dimmed out. So in the 1940s, the New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations in Times Square saw crowds, but no ball drop and no bright lights. In 2020, the celebration will feature a ball drop, but no crowds.  The Times Square Alliance writes that people can celebrate virtually this year by watching a live stream of the celebration. Every year as the clock nears midnight on December 31, the eyes of the world turn once more to the dazzling lights and bustling energy of Times Square. Anticipation runs high. New Year\u2019s Eve at the symbolic center of New York City has become more than just a celebration \u2014 it\u2019s a global tradition. The world holds its breath, and cheers as the clocks strike twelve. As the famous New Year\u2019s Eve Ball descends atop One Times Square, countless people watch Times Square, nationwide, and throughout the world and are united in bidding collective farewell to the departing year and expressing joy and hope for the year ahead. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, NYE 2021 will NOT be open to the public this year \u2014 but there will be live performances, and we hope all of you will enjoy the virtual celebrations safely from the comfort of your own home. New Year\u2019s Eve 2021 might look a little different than usual, but one thing that will never change is the ticking of time and the arrival of a New Year at midnight on December 31st. Celebrate with us virtually in an enhanced celebration that will bring Times Square and the Ball Drop to you no matter where you are. ",

    "claim": "A man who stabbed his pregnant girlfriend \u201cwon\u2019t be charged\u201d because of New York\u2019s recently enacted Reproductive Health Act.",
    "content": " On 22 January 2019, New York state enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), a law that \u2014 as described by its advocates \u2014 was intended to bring New York state, which had legalized abortion prior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, in line with the less restrictive federal standards generated by that ruling and modern medical guidelines: The Reproductive Health Act would fix a troubling gap in New York\u2019s abortion law. New York reformed its abortion law in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. While New York\u2019s abortion statute allows abortion throughout a pregnancy when necessary to preserve a woman\u2019s life, the statute does not allow abortion care after 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy to preserve a woman\u2019s health or in cases of fetal non-viability. Thus, although the U.S. Constitution requires state law to allow for abortion in each of these circumstances, New York law does not comport with Supreme Court jurisprudence and the law is inconsistent with current medical guidelines. The most controversial effect of this act was that it removed abortion from the New York criminal code. Prior to the RHA, homicide charges could encompass the abortion of \u201can unborn child with which a female has been pregnant for more than twenty-four weeks\u201d even if the fetus were not viable. Now in New York abortion is regulated under public health law rather than under the criminal code. This issue drew significant national attention following the New York Post\u2019s coverage of the gruesome murder of Jennifer Irigoyen and her unborn child by her boyfriend, Anthony Hobson: Hobson was captured on surveillance video at around 1 a.m. as he dragged Irigoyen from the hallway of her third-floor apartment to a stairwell, officials said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a knife! He\u2019s going to kill the baby!\u201d Irigoyen had shouted, a witness previously told The Post. The expectant mother was then knifed multiple times in the torso, neck and abdomen, authorities said. She was rushed to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, but neither she nor her unborn baby could be saved.       Hobson was charged with second degree murder on 8 February 2019. The Post later reported that prosecutors had \u201cinitially included a charge of abortion \u2026 but rescinded it because of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s new Reproductive Health Act.\u201d Meris Campbell, a spokeswoman for the New York district attorney, told the New York Times that \u201cprosecutors dropped a second-degree abortion charge after learning that the Reproductive Health Act, which was signed on Jan. 22, had stripped the crime from the state penal code.\u201d This case became a galvanizing point for the pro-life movement. The Times cited the statements of New York State Catholic Conference spokesperson Dennis Poust, who tweeted that \u201cThanks to the #RHA, it\u2019s open season on pregnant women in New York.\u201d On 11 February 2019, Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, penned a story for LifeNews.com with the headline \u201cHe Stabbed His Girlfriend\u2019s Stomach to Kill Her Baby, Won\u2019t Be Charged Because of New York\u2019s Abortion Law.\u201d Donohue\u2019s headline was misleading. Though it was made clear in the body of the article that Dobson was still being charged with second-degree murder, the headline made it sound as though he were not being charged with any crime. According to Daniel R. Alonso, a former chief assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, who spoke to the Times, the dropping of the abortion charge would not have affected Dobson\u2019s potential sentence length: Alonso \u2026 said in an interview \u2026 that charging Mr. Hobson with abortion would not have affected his potential sentence for murder, which supersedes an assault charge. \u201cThe basic thing is, because the killing of the fetus is the same act as the killing of the mother, even though they were separate charges under the old law, you couldn\u2019t get more than 25 to life,\u201d he said. New York State Senators Liz Krueger and Anna Kaplan, the two co-sponsors of the Reproductive Health Act, argued in an 8 February 2019 editorial published in the Albany Times Union that the RHA does not prevent \u201cappropriate charging and sentencing of violent perpetrators\u201d: The RHA removes abortion from the penal code, treating it just like every other medical procedure. This has led to accusations that the RHA eliminates the ability for victims to seek justice when a violent crime causes the loss of a pregnancy. This is yet more misinformation. Physical assault resulting in the loss of pregnancy qualifies as first-degree assault, which carries a penalty of five to 25 years, far more than the previous sentence for \u201cunlawful abortion.\u201d Furthermore, judges have discretion to increase the penalty in cases where the crime was particularly violent. The RHA does not prevent appropriate charging and sentencing of violent perpetrators. The ambiguously constructed assertion presented by LifeNews and others that a man \u201cWon\u2019t Be Charged Because of New York\u2019s Abortion Law\u201d is only partially true. Dobson won\u2019t be charged with \u201cunlawful abortion\u201d because the RHA removed that crime from the state penal code, but he is still charged with murdering his girlfriend, and the dropping of \u201cunlawful abortion\u201d charges against him will not alter his prospective sentence length if he is convicted.

    "claim": "A man named Rudolph Fentz who had mysteriously disappeared 74 years earlier turned up alive in Times Square in 1950.",
    "content": " In 1950, a New York City police officer who was working missing-persons cases examined the body of an approximately 30-year-old man that was brought into the morgue. The man had shown up in the middle of Times Square at 11:15 p.m. that evening, \u201cgawking and looking around at the cars and up at the signs like he\u2019d never seen them before,\u201d then was quickly hit and killed by cab when he tried to cross a street against the traffic lights. The pockets of the deceased\u2019s clothing held multiple pieces of coinage and currency of forms that had not been produced for several decades, yet many of them were in mint condition. His possessions also included items from types of businesses that no longer existed in New York City (i.e., a bill from a livery stable and a brass slug from a saloon), a letter postmarked in 1876, and cards bearing the name Rudolph Fentz with an address on Fifth Avenue. Further investigations turned up no listings for a \u201cRudolph Fentz\u201d in New York City phone directories; the Fifth Avenue address listed on the dead man\u2019s cards had been a business rather than a residence for many years, and no one there had heard of Rudolph Fentz; the deceased\u2019s fingerprints matched none on file; and no current missing-persons reports or inquiries fit the details of the body in the morgue. Moreover, the dead man\u2019s clothes appeared to be about 75 years out of date in style, his apparel bore tags with the name and address of a tailor whom no one had ever heard of, and his hat bore a tag from a store that had gone out of business many years earlier. The investigating officer finally turned up a listing in an old phone directory for a \u201cRudolph Fentz, Jr.,\u201d a man in his sixties who had passed away five years earlier. His widow had since moved to Florida, but by mail she supplied the information that her husband\u2019s father, Rudolph Fentz, had disappeared sometime in the 1870s, having gone out for a walk around 10:00 p.m. one evening and never returned. A search of the missing-persons file for 1876 turned up a report for a \u201cRudolph Fentz,\u201d whose clothing and address corresponded to those of the man killed in Times Square in 1950.  This ostensible report from NYPD Capt. Hubert V. Rihm about the unexplained disappearance \u2014 and inexplicable reappearance 74 years later \u2014 of what appeared to be Rudolph Fentz has been reproduced in various forms since the 1970s as one of the many tales that seemingly confirms the existence of time travel. Yet it is not a true account at all, but rather an excerpt from a short story titled \u201cI\u2019m Scared,\u201d which was penned by science fiction writer Jack Finney (whose best known work was the novel \u201cThe Body Snatchers\u201d) and published in Collier\u2019s magazine in 1951. In that story, the narrator is puzzled when he catches a broadcast of a radio program that had gone off the air several years earlier. He then tracks a series of unusual events that are indicative of temporal disturbances: A man received a telephone call from his sister that she insisted she hadn\u2019t made until three days later; a bank discovered that a check had been deposited the day before it was written; a letter mailed from Wyoming was delivered to a New York City address just seventeen minutes later; and a man was shot and killed by a gun that police had found and impounded the previous day. The narrative involving Capt. Rihm and the reappearance of Fentz was the longest and most detailed vignette offered in \u201cI\u2019m Scared\u201d as evidence of the narrator\u2019s discovery of rifts in time occurring all around New York City. The cause of those temporal disturbances \u2014 and the message of \u201cI\u2019m Scared\u201d \u2014 was explicated in the story\u2019s closing paragraphs: Haven\u2019t you noticed, too, on the part of nearly everyone you know, a growing rebellion against the present? And an increasing longing for the past? I have. Never before in all my long life have I head so many people wish that they lived \u201cat the turn of the century,\u201d or \u201cwhen life was simple,\u201d or \u201cworth living,\u201d or \u201cwhen you could bring children into the world and count on the future,\u201dor simply \u201cin the good old days.\u201d People didn\u2019t talk that way when I was young! The present was a glorious time! But they talk that way now. For the first time in man\u2019s history, man is desperate to escape the present. Our newsstands are jammed with escape literature, the very name of which is significant. Entire magazines are devoted to fantastic stories of escape \u2014 to other times, past and future, to other worlds and planets \u2014 escape to anywhere but here and now. Even our larger magazines, book publishers and Hollywood are beginning to meet the rising demand for this kind of escape. Yes, there is a craving in this world like a thirst, a terrible mass pressure that you can almost feel, of millions of minds struggling against the barriers of time. I am utterly convinced that this terrible mass pressure of millions of minds is already, slightly but definitely, affecting time itself. In the moments when this happens \u2014 when the almost universal longing to escape is greatest \u2014 my incidents occur. Man is disturbing the clock of time, and I am afraid it will break. When it does, I leave to your imagination the last few hours of madness that will be left to us; all the countless moments that now make up our lives suddenly ripped apart and chaotically tangled in time. Well, I have lived most of my life; I can be robbed of only a few more years. But it seems too bad \u2014 this universal craving to escape what could be a rich, productive, happy world. We live on a planet well able to provide a decent life for every soul on it, which is all ninety-nine of a hundred human beings ask. Why in the world can\u2019t we have it? ",

    "claim": "An astrophysicist warned that a \"newly discovered Planet X\" could wipe out all life on Earth as early as April 2016.",
    "content": " On 6 April 2016, the New York Post aggregated a news item originally published by the UK tabloid The Sun, which cited \u201ctop space scientist\u201d Daniel Whitmire as holding that a \u201cnewly discovered planet could destroy Earth any day now\u201d: A mysterious planet that wiped out life on Earth millions of years ago could do it again, according to a top space scientist. And some believe the apocalyptic event could happen as early as this month. Planet Nine \u2014 a new planet discovered at the edge of the solar system in January \u2014 has triggered comet showers that bomb the Earth\u2019s surface, killing all life, says Daniel Whitmire, of the University of Louisiana. The astrophysicist says the planet has a 20,000-year orbit around the sun and, at its closest to us, it knocks asteroids and comets toward Earth. Fossil evidence has suggested most life on Earth is mysteriously wiped out every 26 million to 27 million years. Whitmire claims Planet Nine\u2019s passage through a rock-laden area called the Kuiper Belt is responsible for the \u201cextinction events.\u201d The material as presented was hardly convincing from an astrophysics-centric perspective, as its most compelling portions utilized weasel words such as \u201csome believe\u201d and \u201csome are convinced\u201d without elaborating upon whether \u201csome\u201d were actual scientists or apocalypse cultists. We located some additional information on the topic via a 30 March 2016 press release from the University of Arkansas concerning \u201cPlanet X\u201d and other mass extinctions that have been observed in global fossil records: Periodic mass extinctions on Earth, as indicated in the global fossil record, could be linked to a suspected ninth planet, according to research published by a faculty member of the University of Arkansas Department of Mathematical Sciences. Daniel Whitmire, a retired professor of astrophysics now working as a math instructor, published findings in the January issue of Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that the as yet undiscovered \u201cPlanet X\u201d triggers comet showers linked to mass extinctions on Earth at intervals of approximately 27 million years.       An initial red flag that appeared in contrasting the Post\u2018s outlandish claims and the university press release was the age of some of the discoveries in question. While the current viral article repeatedly references an imminent apocalyptic event due to a \u201cnewly discovered\u201d planet, the university press release describes study that has been ongoing for more than 30 years: Whitmire and his colleague, John Matese, first published research on the connection between Planet X and mass extinctions in the journal Nature in 1985 while working as astrophysicists at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Their work was featured in a 1985 Time magazine cover story titled, \u201cDid Comets Kill the Dinosaurs? A Bold New Theory About Mass Extinctions.\u201d More illuminating is the fact that the university press release makes absolutely no mention whatsoever of any imminent catastrophes. That item is notably inconclusive and ends with a question about the planet\u2019s potential impact on the fossil record over the course of millions of years: Whitemire and Matese\u2019s theory is that as Planet X orbits the sun, its tilted orbit slowly rotates and Planet X passes through the Kuiper belt of comets every 27 million years, knocking comets into the inner solar system. The dislodged comets not only smash into the Earth, they also disintegrate in the inner solar system as they get nearer to the sun, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth. In 1985, a look at the paleontological record supported the idea of regular comet showers dating back 250 million years. Newer research shows evidence of such events dating as far back as 500 million years. Whitmire and Matese published their own estimate on the size and orbit of Planet X in their original study. They believed it would be between one and five times the mass of Earth, and about 100 times more distant from the sun, much smaller numbers than Caltech\u2019s estimates. Matese has since retired and no longer publishes. Whitmire retired from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2012 and began teaching at the University of Arkansas in 2013. Whitmire says what\u2019s really exciting is the possibility that a distant planet may have had a significant influence on the evolution of life on Earth.  \u201cI\u2019ve been part of this story for 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is ever a final answer I\u2019d love to write a book about it.\u201d We contacted Whitmire via e-mail to ask about the Post\u2018s claim that all life on Earth could be wiped out in April 2016, and he quickly replied: \u201c\u200bNo truth to the story at all. That\u2019s quite impossible.\u201d We also got in touch with the press department at the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s Hayden Planetarium to find out more, but we have not yet received a response. Nonetheless, aside from the alarmist claims of two tabloids, we found no evidence there was any truth to the immediacy of the \u201cPlanet X\u201d rumors. ",

    "claim": "Some steam radiators built in older apartment buildings in cities like New York were designed to keep dwellings warm with windows open due to the 1918 pandemic.",
    "content": " Just over a century ago, another virus-born pandemic was ravaging the world: The 1918 flu pandemic (sometimes called the Spanish flu), which killed millions globally in 1918 and 1919. And as the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 rages on, many are discovering that vestiges of the 1918 pandemic are suddenly relevant again. One such vestige is the bete noire of many New Yorkers \u2014 oversized, noisy radiators that overheat apartments. The radiators were built to keep dwellings warm with open windows on the coldest days.  NEW YORKERS: Today I learned the design for these radiators came about during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. Engineers wanted to keep an apartment warm while ventilating the space from airborne illnesses because THEY WERE MEANT TO BE KEPT ON WITH THE WINDOWS FULLY OPEN (!!!!) pic.twitter.com/OmomgkOmAv \u2014 Ana Bret\u00f3n (@missbreton) December 8, 2020  Although public health experts in the early 20th century didn\u2019t have the technology available in 2020 to detect and analyze viruses, they intuited that opening windows was safer during a pandemic than having people sitting indoors, breathing stale air. The Bloomberg story linked in the above tweet states: Health officials thought (correctly) that fresh air would ward off airborne diseases; then as now, cities rushed to move activities outdoors, from schools to courtrooms. When winter came, the need for fresh air didn\u2019t abate. According to [heating industry expert and author Dan] Holohan\u2019s research, the Board of Health in New York City ordered that windows should remain open to provide ventilation, even in cold weather. In response, engineers began devising heating systems with this extreme use case in mind. Steam heating and radiators were designed to heat buildings on the coldest day of the year with all the windows open. Anybody who\u2019s thrown their windows open in January, when their apartment is stifling, is, in an odd way, replicating what engineers hoped would happen a century ago.       Holohan told The New York Times in 2016 that the 1918 flu pandemic inspired something called the \u201cFresh Air Movement,\u201d the push to keep windows open to circulate as much fresh air as possible, as a stopgap measure to prevent the spread of airborne diseases: Much of New York City\u2019s overheating problem can be attributed to the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, said Dan Holohan, a historian of heating and the author of 18 books on the subject. \u201cI first spotted this in my engineering books from the 1920s,\u201d he said. \u201cThe authors would mention the \u2018Fresh Air Movement\u2019 and caution that both boilers and radiators now had to be much larger because of the need to keep windows open by command of the Board of Health.\u201d Fresh air was specifically thought to ward off airborne illnesses like the flu. Although the Spanish Flu abated in 1920, the engineering standards dictating oversize radiators remained. The 1918 flu pandemic was the \u201cmost severe pandemic in recent history,\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It killed 50 million people worldwide, while it\u2019s estimated that \u201c500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population became infected with this virus.\u201d Roughly 675,000 Americans died during the pandemic. Like the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, the disease was airborne, but the CDC notes that while modern laboratories have synthesized it for study, the properties that made it so deadly at the time are not well understood. Unlike the current pandemic, the 1918 flu pandemic virus killed primarily young people. As we noted above, the 1918 flu pandemic was called the \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d but that was a misleading term. The origin of the virus is unknown. But the nickname \u201cSpanish flu\u201d took hold because as it spread during World War I, countries involved in the war attempted to suppress news reporting on the issue, to avoid lowering national morale and causing panic during the Great War, according to USA Today. Spain was neutral in the war, and the news media there was openly reporting on it, especially when Spanish King Alfonso XIII fell gravely ill with the virus. Because the Spanish news media reported robustly on the disease while other nations minimized it, it took on the moniker \u201cSpanish flu.\u201d The COVID-19 pandemic, as of this writing, has killed more than 287,000 Americans and 1.5 million people worldwide, sickening millions. Holohan made a brief video on the topic, which can be viewed here:      ",

    "claim": "In the 17th century, New Amsterdam built a protective wall along its northern perimeter (analogous to Trump's border wall) to keep \"bad hombres\" out, but it failed to achieve its stated purpose in that the British successfully invaded the city by sea.",
    "content": " In early January 2019, as the battle between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for Trump\u2019s promised border wall dragged on, social media users weighed in with arguments for and against erecting a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. One of the more interesting claims to emerge from these debates was that a protective wall built by Dutch settlers on the northern border of 17th-century New Amsterdam (now New York City) failed to accomplish its stated purpose \u2014 that is, stopping outsiders from invading the city. In 1664, New Amsterdam was overtaken by the British, who eventually demolished the wall and replaced it with a street (aptly named Wall Street). The specifics of the claims varied from post to post. A 29 December entry shared on the subreddit r/nyc said the wall was built \u201cTo keep the Indians out.\u201d Another version claimed the wall was built to keep the British out:  Do you know why they call it Wall Street in NYC? Because the Dutch literally built a wall to keep the British out of Dutch colonies. You want to know how well walls work? It isn\u2019t called New Amsterdam anymore.https://t.co/VnztJ2jxHU \u2014 Ocular Nervosa (@ocularnervosa) January 5, 2019        And yet another said the wall was built in the 1640s and was meant to keep the \u201cbad hombres\u201d out (an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s characterization of undocumented immigrants):  In the 1640\u2019s the Dutch inhabitants of New Amsterdam built a 12\u2032 wall to keep the bad hombres out. In 1664 the British ignored the wall and took New Amsterdam by sea. It\u2019s now called New York. They took down the wall and built a street. It\u2019s called Wall Street. pic.twitter.com/Cbhp9N8BDW \u2014 Joe Delmonaco (@JoeDelmonaco) January 7, 2019  Although the broad outlines of the story were accurate, the devil (as always) was in the details. The wall was built neither in 1625 nor in the 1640s, but in 1653, the year New Amsterdam, a Dutch settlement comprising the southern tip of Manhattan Island, was formally chartered as a city. The Dutch Republic was at war with England at the time. The stated purpose of the wall was to prevent the English (not Native Americans) from invading by land. According to city records, news reached New Amsterdam\u2019s leadership in March 1653 that British troops were amassing in New England (\u201cfor either defense or attack, which is unknown to us\u201d). They resolved to \u201csurround the greater part of the City with a high stockade and a small breastwork\u201d to defend against a possible land invasion. Thus began the planning and construction of the wall, which would consist of palisades of 9-foot-tall (not 12-foot-tall) wooden planks extending east to west across the breadth of the island. It was completed in four months. One of the best short histories of the New Amsterdam wall is a five-part essay by Michael Lorenzini of the New York City Municipal Archives, based on original records from the period. One thing he points out is that the wall was only one component of a system of defenses that included ditches in front of the wall, cannon emplacements on the river banks, and Fort Amsterdam at the southernmost end of the island, from which the Dutch could fire upon approaching ships.       Although the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652-1654) ended without the wall\u2019s being put to the test, it did play a part in the city\u2019s defense when Native American tribes attacked New Amsterdam in 1655, leaving a section of it damaged by fire. \u201cThe wall was rebuilt and enforced,\u201d Lorenzini told us via email, \u201cand practically every year there was a huge public works project to improve it, including in 1664 when they received word that English ships were on the way.\u201d Despite the end of official hostilities 10 years earlier, the English had never given up their designs on New Amsterdam. When in March 1664 King Charles II deeded all the land from Maine to Delaware to his brother, the Duke of York, the city scrambled to reinforce their defenses. A few months later, four British warships sailed into the harbor with the clear intention of taking the city. Not wanting bloodshed, New Amsterdam surrendered. Not a shot was fired. Is it reasonable to conclude from that outcome (as some critics of Trump\u2019s border wall have argued) that \u201cwalls don\u2019t work\u201d? Arguably, the wall did work, in that the British never attempted to invade New Amsterdam by land. We put the question to Lorenzini, asking him first if he found the comparison between New Amsterdam\u2019s wall and Trump\u2019s border wall apt. \u201cIn some ways, maybe,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut I would say it\u2019s more akin to the walled cities of Europe than a border wall such as the Great Wall of China or Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\u201d One example of a walled city was New Amsterdam\u2019s European namesake, Amsterdam, which was surrounded by defensive walls from the Middle Ages through the late 19th century. But the central purpose of all those walls was repelling invaders, not keeping out immigrants. In fact, the Dutch would have regarded stopping the comings and goings of peaceful foreigners as antithetical to their interests. Lorenzini continued: New Amsterdam was a port city; the lifeblood was the free flow of ships into and out of the docks along the waterfront. They traded with everyone, including the English, and especially the native Americans. What they were afraid of was English troops from the Connecticut and Massachusetts colonies coming into the city from the north, and, post-1655, raids from native tribes. At various times they were in conflict with the English and the tribes, but they always wanted to resolve differences and continue trading. The English were able to take the city peacefully because they promised the merchants to respect the traditions of the Dutch and keep what we would now call the multi-cultural flavor. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it might have been a Dutch city, but it was a city filled with various religions and ethnic groups and they liked it that way, unlike the Puritan cities to the north, which strived for homogeneous societies. So, it was a military border, not a border to provide immigration control. As a military border, it served its purpose \u2014 no one ever attacked the city from the north \u2014 but much like the Maginot Line in France, it provided a false sense of security and was easily bypassed. The Dutch colony of New Netherlands was not just the lower tip of Manhattan. It extended from Albany to Brooklyn and Queens and down to Delaware and a couple-hundred-meter wall was not going to protect the whole colony. Certainly the wall was thought valuable to the city\u2019s defenses by the English, who continued to expand and maintain it (as would the Dutch when they temporarily reclaimed the city in 1673-4) over the next three decades. It wasn\u2019t until 1699, when New York City had essentially outgrown the wall (and the wall had outlived its purpose), that city officials finally petitioned for its demolition, calling for the stones recovered from the battlements that then stood at intervals along the palisades to be repurposed to build a new City Hall. To clear up one last misconception, it is not the case that the street now known as Wall Street only came into existence after the wall was torn down. Known to the Dutch as the Cingel, the street was ready in use when the British assumed control of New Amsterdam in 1664. As they did with the city itself, they simply claimed it as their own and renamed it. ",

    "claim": "A 1922 New York Times article reported that Adolf Hitler \u201cwas merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers\u201d.",
    "content": " On 10 February 2015, the New York Times re-released the first article they ever published about Adolf Hitler, who was then the chairman of the Nazi party. The story, dated 21 November 1922 and republished in the Times\u2018 \u201cFirst Glimpses\u201d section, opened with this introduction: On Nov. 21, 1922, The New York Times gave its readers their first glimpse of Hitler, in a profile that got a lot of things right \u2014 its description of his ability to work a crowd into a fever pitch, ready then and there to stage a coup, presaged his unsuccessful beer hall putsch less than a year later. But the article also got one crucial point very wrong \u2014 despite what \u201cseveral reliable, well-informed sources\u201d told The Times in the third paragraph from the bottom, his anti-Semitism was every bit as genuine and violent as it sounded. This re-release was widely covered by other news outlets immediately after it was posted in 2015, with many of them suggesting or implying its description bore similarities to the political movement of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. An excerpt from that 1922 article reads as follows: But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes. A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you really are leading them.\u201d This story was published early in both Hitler\u2019s career and in the existence of the Nazi party itself, whose followers were then called \u2018Hakenkreuzler,\u2019 or \u2018swastika wavers.\u2019 In November 1922, when this article was first published, Hitler had been Nazi party chairman for just over a year, and it had been only three years since he had delivered his first public political speech. Hitler\u2019s failed attempt to overthrow the local government in Bavaria, known as the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch,\u201d was one year away. The Times reached out to Hitler for comment in 1922, which he declined, as described in the story: \u201cHerr Hitler regrets he is unable to meet you as he is leaving town on important business for several days,\u201d was the answer received by The New York Times correspondent. His important business was going to Regensburg with three special trainloads of Munich admirers for the purpose of holding a series of reactionary inflammatory meetings and incidentally to beat up protesting Socialists and Communists with blackjacks if any dare protest, which is becoming increasingly rarer.

    "claim": "Jeffrey Epstein was spotted driving around at his New Mexico ranch, according to a YouTube clip showing a man in a red truck who resembles Epstein. ",
    "content": " Some conspiracy theories refuse to die. In October 2020, ABQ RAW \u2014 a self-described \u201cguerrilla filmmaking\u201d news organization \u2014 posted a YouTube video claiming that they had visited Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s ranch between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico, and spotted a man there who they believed was Epstein. Epstein was a financier and convicted sex offender, who died in August 2019 while awaiting trial in a New York jail.       The man is seen pulling up in a truck around 50 seconds into the video. The caption for the video says: \u201cJeffrey Epstein may have not killed himself and may be still be alive. We visited the Zorro Ranch recently and saw some interesting things. Take a look at the video and see if Jeffrey Epstein is in fact alive and well.\u201d According to the people behind the video, they saw a red truck pull up as they were filming, and a man inside it held up his phone to record them. Based on a very blurry zoom, the man was said to look like Epstein. The video concludes with the question: \u201cDid Jeffrey Epstein kill himself? It may be completely possible that he has ridden off into the New Mexico sunset.\u201d We know that this is completely false. Multiple reputable sources have confirmed to the media before that Epstein is in fact dead, including Dr. Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner in New York City, who ruled his death a suicide by hanging. Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein\u2019s brother, disputed the official findings and claimed that he had been strangled instead. Baden also observed the autopsy done by city officials. Epstein\u2019s Zorro Ranch, known for being the place where many of his accusers say they were trafficked and raped, is comprised of both public and private property. In 2019, state officials said they were trying to seize the land. Given that multiple experts confirmed Epstein\u2019s autopsy took place, and one cannot have an autopsy without a dead body, we know that Epstein was certainly not on the ranch, and therefore rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d ",

    "claim": "The New York State Department of Health advised people to kiss through handkerchiefs during the 1918 flu pandemic. ",
    "content": " In January 2021, as the United States neared the one-year anniversary of its first confirmed case of COVID-19 and tallied an increasing number of new cases daily, a tweet circulated alleging this recommendation by New York state health officials to avoid spreading influenza during the 1918 pandemic: Kiss through handkerchiefs.  The newspaper clip in the viral tweet was authentic. We used an online archive of historical newspapers and found the original article by the Democrat and Chronicle of New York\u2019s Rochester area, published on Aug. 17, 1918 \u2014 just months after the U.S. recorded its first patients diagnosed with the novel strain of the H1N1 virus that eventually killed about 675,000 Americans. (See our full investigation into how the 1918 pandemic got its \u201cSpanish flu\u201d nickname here.) The Democrat and Chronicle article read in full: Persons who want to avoid the Spanish influenza or the common garden variety of the same disease were warned by the New York City Department of Health to-day not to kiss, \u201cexcept through a handkerchief.\u201d While advising osculatory restraint [New York] Health Commissioner [Royal] Copeland announced that investigation has failed to show any signs of the Spanish affliction aboard the Norwegian steamship which arrived recently with many suspected cases. He declared it was \u201csimply influenza\u201d without the fever, headaches, delirium and nervous disorders associated with the Spanish variety.       That article was published the same day The New York Sun printed the below-displayed story with the same recommendation \u2014 that the \u201chandkerchief kiss \u2026 be brought into vogue at once.\u201d  Led by Copeland, who later served as a U.S. Senator, the New York State Health Department also said \u201cdon\u2019t spit in public places; don\u2019t use common drinking cups, glasses, spoons, forks and similar articles,\u201d and \u201cthere is special danger in drinking from glasses that have not been washed,\u201d The Sun reported. News outlets nationwide reproduced the stories out of New York under their own headlines including, \u201cFlu May Get You, Should You Kiss\u201d (Salt Lake Telegram) and \u201cWant to Kiss and Escape Grip? Use Handkerchief!\u201d (Indianapolis Star), according to Thomas Ewing, a Virgina Tech professor who researches the history of epidemics. In a February 2020 report, he explained how the kissing message went viral (by standards of the early 20th century), while the news media generally ignored, or only summarized, other recommendations by public health authorities to curb the virus\u2019 spread. Ewing said: Warnings against kissing continued as the epidemic caused widespread illness and unprecedented numbers of deaths across the United States. Even as they adopted more drastic measures such as banning public meetings and closing schools, saloons, and stores, local health officials and medical experts echoed Copeland when they cautioned against kissing in Connecticut, Ohio, Salt Lake City, Chicago, and other states and cities. [\u2026] Thinking carefully about risk mitigation measures recommended by authorities, without being distracted by \u201cviral moments,\u201d could result in a more responsible relationship between the American public, health agencies, and the media. Nonetheless, the underlying notion of the handkerchief recommendation \u2014 that fabric facial coverings prevent the spread of disease \u2014 was central to the COVID-19 pandemic more than a century later. In 2020, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged everyone to wear masks over their noses and mouths in public settings to avoid spreading or catching the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spreads via respiratory droplets when people cough, talk, sing, breathe \u2014 and kiss. And modern-day physicians and officials advised people against kissing (or engaging in sexual acts with) people outside of their own households, similarly to the 1918 pandemic.       For example, at a March 2020 news conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested it \u201cwise\u201d for people to skip kissing at the end of dates considering the pandemic. Also, the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a September 2020 statement that people should forgo face-to-face contact with new people altogether unless they \u201cconsider using a mask that covers the nose and mouth.\u201d As for the image in the above tweet depicting a man and a woman wearing fabric masks while kissing, the photograph was taken during a flu epidemic in Hollywood, California, in 1937 \u2014 not 1918 \u2014 according to Getty Images\u2019 database of photos. Nayeema Raza, an opinion producer for The New York Times, used the same photograph for a May 18, 2020, piece titled \u201cWhat Single People Are Starting To Realize.\u201d In sum, considering the articles in the Democrat and Chronicle and The Sun, it was accurate to claim the New York State Department of Health advised people to kiss through handkerchiefs during the 1918 flu pandemic.

    "claim": "Scientists have discovered a fuel thousands of times more powerful than gasoline and just one company is positioned to own a vast majority of its market share.",
    "content": " In April 2017, a viral marketing campaign created by Kent Moors (an allegedly well-resum\u00e9d individual who frequently offers expensive stock tips in ebook form and is sometimes used as an expert on television news segments) suggested that there is a new fuel called OBL that is 1,693 times more powerful than gasoline. The main thesis of his 44-minute video and accompanying article is that it would be wise to purchase cheap stock in an unnamed company that has exclusive access to OBL; however, the only way to find out the name of the company is to purchase a $99 ebook that the video advertises. This post does not seek to address the financial claims made in the ad. Instead, it aims to document the numerous and brazenly misleading scientific claims made about this new \u201csuperfuel\u201d.  What Moors refers to as OBL is lithium brine (found in salt lakes that have high concentrations of lithium) or their geologic deposits in the form of salts like lithium carbonate or lithium chloride. These raw materials are used to make lithium-ion batteries, common in cell phones and increasingly in demand for electric cars. A post at Stock Gumshoe makes a detailed case for concluding OBL is actually this resource, and the stated locations of the deposits (the Andes and Nevada) as well as Moors\u2019 discussion of electric automobile industry further support that conclusion. The reason the ad uses the term OBL (allegedly an acronym for the Spanish translation of \u201cwhite gold,\u201d \u201coro blanco\u201d), instead of the scientifically accurate term lithium carbonate, is likely due to the fact that saying \u201clithium demand will rise in the future as electric cars become more popular\u201d is far from a hot take, as evidenced by a fairly similar take published in Forbes nearly a decade ago:  Since a vehicle battery requires a hundred times as much lithium carbonate as its laptop equivalent, the green-car revolution could make lithium one of the planet\u2019s most strategic commodities. The rush is on to find and develop new sources of it, a race that has mining companies scouring the globe\u2019s remotest corners, from the high-altitude deserts of Chile and Bolivia to the wilds of northern Tibet.        The nearly hour-long, un-fast-forwardable video does not say what OBL is or identify the company with access to it (though it is likely a company called Lithium X), most likely in order to shield Moors\u2019 myriad vague claims from any critical rebuke. These claims are featured prominently in early portions of the video:  Unearthed in the Andes Mountains, these mysterious crystals contain what MIT researchers call energy\u2019s \u201cHoly Grail.\u201d [\u2026] A discovery made 13,000 feet up in the Andes Mountains is going to forever alter the global energy industry. Take a look at this picture. The locals call the mysterious crystals you see here \u201cOro Blanco.\u201d Translated, that\u2019s \u201cWhite Gold.\u201d However, Goldman Sachs has a different name for it. \u201cThe new gasoline.\u201d But that may very well be the understatement of the century. You see, Oro Blanco is 1,693-times more powerful than the gasoline that runs your car. Which is why Goldman Sachs is predicting it will eventually \u201creplace gasoline as the primary source of transportation fuel.\u201d   Before delving into the meat of the claim \u2014 the comparison to gasoline \u2014 it is worth noting that the image Moors asks us to look at is a stock photo of salt from a salt lake, not a groundbreaking image of \u201cblanco oro\u201d. The remarkably specific estimate of \u201c1,693 times more power\u201d than gasoline comes from the specious argument that \u201cone gallon of OBL\u201d can drive your car for 42,325 miles, while a regular gallon of gasoline may last about 25 (42,325 / 25 = 1,693):  Let\u2019s say you own a typical mid-sized American car. So you can probably drive about 25 miles on a gallon of gasoline. Maybe 40-50 if it\u2019s a hybrid-electric model like a Toyota Prius. Care to guess what would happen if you retrofitted your car to run on OBL? 50 miles to the gallon? Maybe 100 MPG? Or 500 MPG? Not even close. I\u2019d like for you to imagine: Pulling into your local gas station on empty, putting only a single gallon of this superfuel in your tank, and driving 42,325 miles before having to stop at that same gas station again. That\u2019s like driving from New York City to Los Angeles and back SEVEN times on a single gallon.  This is a deeply fallacious argument even if there was some basis to the figure 42,325 miles on a \u201cgallon\u201d of \u201cOBL\u201d (though we cannot find one). The explanation Moors gives for OBL\u2019s superior performance sounds nice and neat, but it stems from a comparison that makes apples and oranges look like identical twins:  So you\u2019re probably asking yourself, \u201chow is this even possible?\u201d I\u2019ll give you two reasons. One of them is simple science. And the other sounds like magic. First off, this crystal fuel can withstand extreme temperatures. Consider gasoline. It might start boiling at 104 degrees Fahrenheit. When it does, some amounts will evaporate. That\u2019s potential fuel that is vanishing into thin air. OBL doesn\u2019t have this problem. It doesn\u2019t boil until it hits 2,457 degrees Fahrenheit. [\u2026] Now, the second reason. [\u2026] It\u2019s [sic] \u201cenergy density\u201d is unrivaled.  Gasoline powers a car through the energy created by combustion (which is, incidentally, why you wouldn\u2019t want it to withstand extremely high temperatures), whereas a lithium-ion battery creates its power from the chemical energy generated by the movement of lithium ions.       This renders the first argument irrelevant, even if you ignore the fact that you can\u2019t \u201cfill\u201d a car with the raw precursor component of a lithium-ion battery, and the fact that that a battery requires A) other chemicals and B) the regular input of energy to reset that chemical system (i.e. the part where you charge it every 100-300 miles). The second argument \u2014 that lithium batteries are more energy dense than gasoline \u2014 can more accurately be described as a bald-faced lie. The implication that a lithium-ion battery\u2019s energy density, a quantifiable thermodynamic quality inherent to any substance, is greater than that of gasoline is not only false, it is the defining scientific hurdle to making electric cars a viable economic solution, as discussed in a post by the American Physical Society:  Stored energy in fuel is considerable: gasoline is the champion at 47.5 MJ/kg and 34.6 MJ/liter; the gasoline in a fully fueled car has the same energy content as a thousand sticks of dynamite. A lithium-ion battery pack has about 0.3 MJ/kg and about 0.4 MJ/liter (Chevy VOLT). Gasoline thus has about 100 times the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.  These factual problems are masked by Moors\u2019 frequent sidetracks into technically valid scientific statements that are both utterly irrelevant and diversionary, including this gem:  Astrophysicists have observed OBL being produced by dwarf stars and cosmic rays colliding. The explosion is so intense, it causes the stars to burn up to 100,000 times brighter than they did before. It also sets off a Galactic process known as stellar nucleosynthesis, which gives birth to this superfuel.  Stellar nucleosynthesis, the process that powers stars through nuclear reactions, is responsible for the formation of pretty much all elements heavier than helium in our universe, making this statement broadly true for nearly everything in the universe \u2014 a concept made famous by Carl Sagan\u2019s memorable quote, \u201cWe are made of star stuff,\u201d in the original run of Cosmos.  The statement makes you feel like you could power your car with the force of a stellar explosion, but it is, in reality, a meaningless letdown. This technique is a common one for Moors. In what can only be described as a brilliant use of semantics, he once tried to sell solar energy stock tips by branding solar power as Einstein\u2019s little known theory of \u201cspace energy.\u201d The invention of OBL fits neatly within Moors\u2019 technique of offering opaque hints about stocks while generally abusing science and the English language. The final suggestion made by the video is that this one undisclosed company has exclusive access to American lithium deposits, and therefore has a significant stake in the world market. Excluding the fact that multiple companies have ownership of different regions of the general deposit to which Moors refers (and that five companies dominate this market globally), the Nevada deposits are speculative and not necessarily viable, as discussed in a feature about the future of the American lithium market in Fortune:  Pure Energy Minerals [one company with an interest in the Nevada deposits] is trying to determine, and prove with its samples and testing, that the lithium brine in Clayton Valley is as high quality and in abundance as the small four-person team thinks it is. The company estimates that there are 816,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent underneath their land claims that stretch over 9,000 acres, or 14 square miles, of the basin. Lithium carbonate is a lithium compound and it\u2019s a standard way that lithium supplies are measured. In comparison, the global reserves of lithium carbonate equivalent\u2014which is the amount that can be economically mined right now\u2014is estimated to be about 75 million metric tons, according to the United States Geological Survey. The U.S. can only claim about 203,000 metric tons of those reserves right now.  To be clear, we are not arguing that lithium will not become a major player in the energy market, nor are we arguing that companies investing in American deposits are necessarily a bad bet, but merely highlighting another aspect of an impressively dishonest presentation. Ultimately, we rate this claim as false because it uses demonstrably misleading or false claims about the science behind the production and use of lithium batteries, invents terminology to hide the actual resource being discussed, and oversells the scarcity of access to deposits as well as the novelty of the resource, all with the motivation of selling an e-book for profit.
